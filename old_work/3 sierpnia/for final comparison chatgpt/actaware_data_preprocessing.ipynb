Experts told DailyMail.com that trying to do a 'hard restart' is one way to fix the problem\\n\\nA bug plaguing the new iPhone 14 Pro Max is mysteriously freezing smartphones - sometimes to the point where the device is unusable.\\n\\nMany users have reported the issue, which appears to happen when users charge their phone, transfer data from previous phones or connecting to WiFi.\\n\\nIt comes despite Apple rolling out several iOS updates since the iPhone 14 Pro Max launched last September.\\n\\nOne user told DailyMail.com how her handset froze and died while charging overnight, meaning her alarm never went off. She had to wake her husband to call a cab in the morning so she wouldn't be late for work.\\n\\nMany frustrated smartphone owners are airing similar grievances on social media and Apple's official forum, noting that they have never had this issue with previous models.\\n\\nOne user wrote on Apple's website: \\u2018I charged my iPhone before I went to bed and woke up, and it's a black screen and won't turn on. I've tried clicking on the volume +/ - and power button sequence to no avail.\\n\\nApple will use chips made at a new $12 billion Arizona factory as firm pivots away from China CEO Tim Cook confirmed that Apple use chips from a factory in the U.S. in the coming years Advertisement !- - ad: - ->\\n\\n\\u2018Doing a quick online search, others are also experiencing this issue, and is sic some Apple bug. Not really sure what to do other than having to visit an Apple Store to get it wiped and OS reinstalled. How frustrating.\\u2019\\n\\nOthers report the handset freezing while in use.\\n\\nOne user of the iPhone 14 Pro Max wrote: 'This is happening to me ALL THE TIME. I couldn't even restart the phone for 2 hours as it sat on the screen to 'slide to restart'. It's infuriating and I have no idea what to do.'\\n\\nAnother described a recurrent problem that Apple Store employees could not fix, saying: 'With iOS 16.2 I am experiencing random freezes which force me to restart the iPhone completely.\\n\\n'I noticed it must have to do with the iPhone losing the internet connection (doesn't matter if on wifi or cellular) because I open, for example, Mail and it cannot load the mail. Keeps loading and loading, then the Mail app gets all white.'\\n\\nOn social media, users have described devices freezing when they open applications or trigger notifications.\\n\\nTwitter user Penny Henderson wrote: 'iPhone 14 pro max, hands down worst phone I've owned, glitchy, apps freeze daily, I think I'll ask for my money back! Apple it's not ready for sale. Should be ashamed of yourselves.'\\n\\nMac and iOS YouTuber Aaron Zollo said this month: 'More and more people keep telling me all the issues with iOS 16.2. Hope we get a major bug fix soon. Hearing this more each day.'\\n\\niPhone 14 Max Pro owners have shared their frustrations on Twitter, with some stating this is the worst iPhone yet\\n\\nApple has released several iOS updates since the smartphone launched in September, but none of them seem to fix the freezing bug\\n\\nIn an internal memo obtained by Apple news site MacRumors, Apple admitted investigating a bug that saw iPhone 14 models, including the iPhone 14 Pro Max, freezing when customers transferred data from an older iPhone.\\n\\nIn the memo, Apple said that its engineers were, 'aware of this issue happening and are investigating.'\\n\\nApple has rolled out several software updates since iPhone 14 launched in early September last year, with a new 16.3 iOS update rolling out on January 13.\\n\\nCellphone expert Steven Athwal of retailer The Big Phone Store told DailyMail.com that while there do appear to be lots of reports of iPhones freezing, there are easy fixes\\n\\n'Apple's newest mobile phone model, the iPhone 14, hasn't had the best start, with users reporting problems with the phone constantly freezing,' said Athwal.\\n\\n'If your iPhone does freeze, I suggest trying to do a 'hard restart' - this is where you manually turn the phone off and then on again by holding down certain buttons.\\n\\n'Start by pressing the volume UP button, then releasing it, then doing the same with the volume DOWN button.\\n\\nUsers are in an uproar about the freezing bug. An expert told DailyMail.com that this issue may be caused by the iPhone being overloaded\\n\\nThe expert suggested closing open apps to relieve the overload\\n\\n'Next, press and hold down the side button (found on the right side of your device) until the Apple logo appears. This should resolve most freezing issues, but if you're still stuck, try plugging your phone into a PC or laptop and connecting to iTunes instead.'\\n\\nIf you are facing repeated freezes, Athwal suggests some measures that could help and are easily accessible from your iPhone's Settings menu.\\n\\n'Most of the time, iPhones freeze due to being overloaded by too many processes, so if the problem persists, I suggest closing any unused apps or changing what runs in the background,' he explained.\\n\\n'You can find this data in your Settings, and even set apps to only open when you need them.'\\n\\n'I also recommend keeping an eye on your storage as this can quickly slow down your iPhone and make it more likely to crash, so delete images and videos you don't want and transfer files onto iCloud as soon as possible.'\\n\\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Apple for comment on the issue but has not had a reply.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PublishedDate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ProcessingSteps\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NERs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QType\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"MatchedCompanies\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ImageUrl\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10685,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://actawarenewsdev.blob.core.windows.net/article-images/640e8eb51b843b2bcab095d9.png\",\n          \"https://actawarenewsdev.blob.core.windows.net/article-images/65009f3ba9db7bd5dcf5dab5.png\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that.\\n\\n'He was called Pilot Poison.

Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively.\\n\\nIn the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home.\\n\\nNow it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer.\\n\\nThe move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year.\\n\\nIt signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle.\\n\\nReturns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store.\\n\\nFigures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US.\\n\\nMore generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales.\\n\\nThis is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back.\\n\\nReturned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits.\\n\\nLast month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses.\\n\\nBut the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices.\\n\\nAmazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's.\\n\\nIt encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees.\\n\\nAmazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations\\n\\nH&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022\\n\\nAmazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.'\\n\\nZara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year.\\n\\nIt was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"TitleTokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QTypeLogprob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17113032392279354,\n        \"min\": -1.7288656558,\n        \"max\": -0.001752815287,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2417,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.01874868716384,\n          -0.0205807598625,\n          -0.007729795147599999\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home.\\n\\nNow it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer.\\n\\nThe move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year.\\n\\nIt signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle.\\n\\nReturns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store.\\n\\nFigures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US.\\n\\nMore generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales.\\n\\nThis is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back.\\n\\nReturned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits.\\n\\nLast month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses.\\n\\nBut the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices.\\n\\nAmazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's.\\n\\nIt encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees.\\n\\nAmazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations\\n\\nH&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022\\n\\nAmazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.'\\n\\nZara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year.\\n\\nIt was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"Before the US embargo, Cuba's home-grown coffee was world famous Cuba conjures up images of big cigars, classic American cars, revolution, rum and Fidel Castro. What the Caribbean island is less well known for is coffee. Once one of the world's biggest producers, coffee growing has slumped since US President John F Kennedy imposed an economic embargo on Castro's pro-Soviet regime in early 1962 – but there are hopes of a revival. Britain's many lovers of a morning coffee will soon have a chance to judge for themselves whether Cuba's product still has the famed chocolate and nutty flavours, complemented by overtones of tobacco, that gained it a world-class reputation before the embargo. Flying the flag: Cuba produced 50,000 tons a year at its peak in the 1950s, but the latest annual production total is just 8,000 tons Italian coffee giant Lavazza has just struck a deal with Sainsbury's and Waitrose to bring Cuban coffee to the UK market for the first time. It will be available under the Tierra label. It is part of a wider plan to kickstart the Cuban coffee sector which, under the embargo, has virtually disappeared. It produced 50,000 tons a year at its peak in the 1950s. The latest annual production total is just 8,000 tons. The grinding US sanctions continue to exact a huge toll on all aspects of economic life in Cuba, making it a Cold War relic which is seemingly frozen in time. Cuba imports most of the food and fuel it consumes. Power cuts are common as the cash-starved economy nosedives. Inflation is a startling 45 per cent and the currency is in freefall. Tourists have failed to return in significant numbers since the pandemic, depriving Cuba of foreign currency and spending power. But resurrecting the coffee industry would be an important step for Cuba, as coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities. The revival is centred in the Sierra Maestra mountains of eastern Cuba. Steeped in history, it was from this thickly forested range that Castro and his revolutionaries launched a series of guerilla attacks on the country's government. Revival: Farmer Tony Infante, right, is switching over from cattle to coffee The military dictator Fulgencio Batista was eventually overthrown in 1959. As the US sanctions make it difficult for businesses to operate there, Lavazza has been working through its charitable foundation for several years in this region to kickstart the industry. Hefty subsidies from the Cuban government to plant coffee in the forests are also bolstering efforts. Lavazza has been busy teaching farming techniques and marketing nous to around 170 farmers in the area in a campaign to revive the coffee growing industry. 'The project is about creating the environment for Cuban coffee to be sold,' says Veronica Rossi, senior sustainability manager with the foundation. Rafael Antonio Infante, also known as 'Tony', is one of the farmers working with Lavazza. Tony used to rear cattle but has turned over a third of his 37 acre farm to growing organic, hand-picked coffee. And he is looking to expand. Why? 'Because the market is secure – and coffee is more profitable than cows,' he laughs. Lavazza's foundation – which works in 20 countries on three continents to improve coffee crop yields – has taken a leading role following a partnership with Oxfam in Cuba in 2018. Oxfam later closed all of its Caribbean offices as part of a cost- cutting drive after donations dried up during the pandemic, so the foundation was left to deal directly with the Cuban government. 'This is the first time we've partnered with a government and turned it into a joint venture,' Rossi explains. 'It's a very good experiment for us.' All the profits made from exporting Cuban coffee will be reinvested in the 20-year project, she adds. MIDAS SHARE TIPS: Sign up a high flying recruiter like Gattaca to lift your funds Companies, politicians and policy wonks are often at odds but they are in almost unanimous agreement on one point – the UK needs more technology geeks, scientists and engineers. Gattaca is a recruitment firm specialising in the so-called STEM sector – science, technology, engineering and maths. The stock is trading at £1.24, the company is in the middle of a turnaround programme under chief executive Matthew Wragg and the price should increase as his efforts bear fruit. 'Cuban coffee is good, fair and clean' Cuba's coffee comeback will take time and scaling up will be hampered as long as sanctions remain. Only last month the UK was among 187 countries that backed a United Nations resolution to lift the blockade on Cuba. But it remains in place after the move was vetoed by the US, which still describes Cuba as a terrorist state. Perhaps Vietnam – another one-party, centralised communist country – provides a template. In just four decades it has come from nowhere to be the world's second largest coffee producer. The difference is that Vietnam cleared its forests to make way for coffee plantations. Cuba has gone the opposite way, re-foresting on a huge scale. That, and the fact that it lacks fertilisers because of the blockade, bolsters Cuba's sustainable 'green' coffee credentials. The use of blockchain technology – giving each coffee bag its own code that cannot be changed –enhances certification. Robeldi Nicot Terrero, president of Agroforestal, the state-owned company which manages the environment, insists Cuba can compete on the world stage again. 'Cuban coffee is the best,' he says. 'It's good, fair and clean.'\""

The Grey's Anatomy alum, 59, took to Twitter on Tuesday with a lengthy statement announcing his early retirement and letting fans know that his film Corsicana may be his final acting project. 'It is with a heavy heart and a sense of relief that I am announcing my early retirement from the entertainment industry today,' the actor - who was fired from Grey's Anatomy in 2007 after allegedly using a gay slur against costar T.R. Knight - wrote. 'Those who have been Following/Witnessing my journey here on Twa***r since 2011 all know that I have fought the good fight, but it seems that the haters, provocateurs and the Useful Idiots have won.' The Texas-born star also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I'm no longer interested in the back and forth regarding a \\\"color construct\\\" that keeps us human beings divided nor am I interested in politics or anything vitriolic. I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism.'

Washington went on to add: 'I am truly grateful for your support over the years. It looks like CORSICANA #CorsicanaMovie may be the last time you see me as an Actor born here in America.' He wrapped up his statement writing: 'Just know that I will be posting a few pictures of my retirement shenanigans here and there, but until then. Be safe out there. Your loved ones love you and need you. SALUTE!' Isaiah stars as Bass Reeves in the 2022 film Corsicana, which he says will be his last. He also directed and wrote the feature. The film follows former slave turned U.S. marshal who tracks an outlaw gang of killers to Corsicana, Texas. The thriller also stars Lew Temple, Stacey Dash and Noel Gugliemi. Washington rose to fame playing the highly skilled cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was an original cast member of the show, but was fired in 2007 following three seasons, after being accused of using a homophobic slur in reference to co-star T. R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set. He later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.' Plans: The 'Frederick Douglass Conservative' also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism'; Pictured 2021 Dr. Burke: Washington rose to fame playing Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was fired in 2007 after using a homophobic slur against co-star T.R.

Knight, Patrick Dempsey, Justin Chambers, Katherine Heigl, and Chandra Wilson in 2005 promo shot In 2021 Isaiah opened up about his experiences on the Grey\\u2019s Anatomy set, and what he said were many toxic elements in play involving key figures on the ABC medical drama, in particular former leading man Patrick Dempsey. He spoke on KBLA Talk 1580 radio show saying that his firing 'was an agenda to cover up for the toxic and bad behavior of many of my former castmates on that show ... and the top of that would be Patrick Dempsey.' Washington said that his tension with Dempsey, 57, was initially based on finances. 'I was the highest paid person on that show, next to Patrick Dempsey,' he said. 'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that. 'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added. As of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad. 'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show. In 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist. They killed the actor [in me] on June 7, 2007.'\",\n          \"Last updated on .From the section Women's Football Glasgow City travel to take on Rangers this weekend The BBC is to broadcast live coverage of 11 SWPL matches over the next six weeks.

The e-commerce giant slaps the sum on returns made to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to the shopper's delivery address. But the sum is a relatively modest charge compared to other big brands which have increasingly begun implementing similar fees. T.J. Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively. In the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home. Now it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer. The move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year. It signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle. Returns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store. Figures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US. More generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales. This is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back. Returned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits. Last month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses. But the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices. Amazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's. It encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees. Amazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations H&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022 Amazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.' Zara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year. It was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported. The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime' Alexander now faces having the role stripped from him after he reportedly signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel an 'apartheid regime' Aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City on October 11 The letter which was allegedly signed by Alexander, who is non-binary and uses he/him pronouns, said: 'We are watching a genocide take place in real time. 'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.' Olly Alexander performing live on stage with his band Years and Years at Wembley Arena in 2022 Sir Elton John and Olly Alexander perform during The BRIT Awards 2021 at The O2 Arena The UK has won Eurovision five times, with the last time being in 1997 when Katrina & The Waves performed Love Shine A Light . Prior to that, the UK stormed to victory in 1981 with Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up, and in 1976 with Brotherhood Of Man's Save Your Kisses For Me. In 1969, Lulu, who performed Boom Bang-a-Bang came first in a four-way joint tie with France, the Netherlands and Spain. The UK's first ever Eurovision victory came 11 years after the annual competition launched with Sandie Shaw's Puppet on a String in 1967. Israel has won the competition four times after its debut in the competition in 1973 as the first non-European country to participate in the event.

The Grey's Anatomy alum, 59, took to Twitter on Tuesday with a lengthy statement announcing his early retirement and letting fans know that his film Corsicana may be his final acting project. 'It is with a heavy heart and a sense of relief that I am announcing my early retirement from the entertainment industry today,' the actor - who was fired from Grey's Anatomy in 2007 after allegedly using a gay slur against costar T.R. Knight - wrote. 'Those who have been Following/Witnessing my journey here on Twa***r since 2011 all know that I have fought the good fight, but it seems that the haters, provocateurs and the Useful Idiots have won.' The Texas-born star also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I'm no longer interested in the back and forth regarding a \\\"color construct\\\" that keeps us human beings divided nor am I interested in politics or anything vitriolic. I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism.'

Washington went on to add: 'I am truly grateful for your support over the years. It looks like CORSICANA #CorsicanaMovie may be the last time you see me as an Actor born here in America.' He wrapped up his statement writing: 'Just know that I will be posting a few pictures of my retirement shenanigans here and there, but until then. Be safe out there. Your loved ones love you and need you. SALUTE!' Isaiah stars as Bass Reeves in the 2022 film Corsicana, which he says will be his last. He also directed and wrote the feature. The film follows former slave turned U.S. marshal who tracks an outlaw gang of killers to Corsicana, Texas. The thriller also stars Lew Temple, Stacey Dash and Noel Gugliemi. Washington rose to fame playing the highly skilled cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was an original cast member of the show, but was fired in 2007 following three seasons, after being accused of using a homophobic slur in reference to co-star T. R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set. He later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.' Plans: The 'Frederick Douglass Conservative' also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism'; Pictured 2021 Dr. Burke: Washington rose to fame playing Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was fired in 2007 after using a homophobic slur against co-star T.R. Knight while arguing with actor Patrick Dempsey on set; Still from Grey's Anatomy Throwback: The two worked together for the first three seasons of Grey's Anatomy from 2005 to 2007; (L-R) Washington, Sandra Oh, James Pickens Jr, Ellen Pompeo, T.R. Knight, Patrick Dempsey, Justin Chambers, Katherine Heigl, and Chandra Wilson in 2005 promo shot In 2021 Isaiah opened up about his experiences on the Grey\\u2019s Anatomy set, and what he said were many toxic elements in play involving key figures on the ABC medical drama, in particular former leading man Patrick Dempsey. He spoke on KBLA Talk 1580 radio show saying that his firing 'was an agenda to cover up for the toxic and bad behavior of many of my former castmates on that show ... and the top of that would be Patrick Dempsey.' Washington said that his tension with Dempsey, 57, was initially based on finances. 'I was the highest paid person on that show, next to Patrick Dempsey,' he said. 'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that. 'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added. As of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad. 'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show. In 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist. They killed the actor [in me] on June 7, 2007.'\",\n          \"Last updated on .From the section Women's Football Glasgow City travel to take on Rangers this weekend The BBC is to broadcast live coverage of 11 SWPL matches over the next six weeks.

The e-commerce giant slaps the sum on returns made to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to the shopper's delivery address. But the sum is a relatively modest charge compared to other big brands which have increasingly begun implementing similar fees. T.J. Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively. In the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home. Now it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer. The move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year. It signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle. Returns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store. Figures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US. More generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales. This is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back. Returned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits. Last month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses. But the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices. Amazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's. It encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees. Amazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations H&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022 Amazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.' Zara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year. It was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Knight - wrote. 'Those who have been Following/Witnessing my journey here on Twa***r since 2011 all know that I have fought the good fight, but it seems that the haters, provocateurs and the Useful Idiots have won.' The Texas-born star also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I'm no longer interested in the back and forth regarding a \\\"color construct\\\" that keeps us human beings divided nor am I interested in politics or anything vitriolic.

Washington went on to add: 'I am truly grateful for your support over the years. It looks like CORSICANA #CorsicanaMovie may be the last time you see me as an Actor born here in America.' He wrapped up his statement writing: 'Just know that I will be posting a few pictures of my retirement shenanigans here and there, but until then. Be safe out there. Your loved ones love you and need you. SALUTE!' Isaiah stars as Bass Reeves in the 2022 film Corsicana, which he says will be his last. He also directed and wrote the feature. The film follows former slave turned U.S. marshal who tracks an outlaw gang of killers to Corsicana, Texas. The thriller also stars Lew Temple, Stacey Dash and Noel Gugliemi. Washington rose to fame playing the highly skilled cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was an original cast member of the show, but was fired in 2007 following three seasons, after being accused of using a homophobic slur in reference to co-star T. R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set. He later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.'

He spoke on KBLA Talk 1580 radio show saying that his firing 'was an agenda to cover up for the toxic and bad behavior of many of my former castmates on that show ... and the top of that would be Patrick Dempsey.' Washington said that his tension with Dempsey, 57, was initially based on finances. 'I was the highest paid person on that show, next to Patrick Dempsey,' he said. 'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that. 'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added. As of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad. 'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show. In 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist.

The e-commerce giant slaps the sum on returns made to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to the shopper's delivery address. But the sum is a relatively modest charge compared to other big brands which have increasingly begun implementing similar fees. T.J. Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively. In the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home. Now it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer. The move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year. It signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle. Returns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store. Figures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US. More generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales. This is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back. Returned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits. Last month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses. But the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices. Amazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's. It encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees. Amazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations H&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022 Amazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.' Zara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year. It was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported.

'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.' Olly Alexander performing live on stage with his band Years and Years at Wembley Arena in 2022 Sir Elton John and Olly Alexander perform during The BRIT Awards 2021 at The O2 Arena The UK has won Eurovision five times, with the last time being in 1997 when Katrina & The Waves performed Love Shine A Light . Prior to that, the UK stormed to victory in 1981 with Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up, and in 1976 with Brotherhood Of Man's Save Your Kisses For Me. In 1969, Lulu, who performed Boom Bang-a-Bang came first in a four-way joint tie with France, the Netherlands and Spain. The UK's first ever Eurovision victory came 11 years after the annual competition launched with Sandie Shaw's Puppet on a String in 1967.

The It\\'s A Sin star signed an open letter from LGBTQ+ activist group Voices4London, which called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for Israel to allow aid into the area. The letter says: \"We are watching a genocide take place in real time. Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. \"And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli Government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. We once said, \\'silence equals death\\'. Now is not the time to be silent.\" \"We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel\\'s apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land.\" The organisation added: \"We strongly reject the argument that holding a pro-Palestine or anti-zionist stance in any way promotes antisemitism. \"We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. \"For the many queer and anti-zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of antisemitism.\" Advertisement Hamas killed around 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds more in cross-border attacks on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has since killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, 70% of whom were women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. A number of human rights groups have repeatedly labelled Israel an apartheid state, with Amnesty International saying: \"The discrimination, the dispossession, the repression of dissent, the killings and injuries - all are part of a system which is designed to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.\" Read more: Israel to compete at Eurovision despite boycott threats Ukrainian Eurovision winner on Russia wanted list says Kremlin is trying to \\'scare\\' her Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:45 What is genocide?

At a time when nearly seven in 10 British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. \"The BBC can and must right this wrong.\" Philosemitism is controversial term that can refer to a special interest in, respect for, or admiration for Jewish people, Jewish history, or Jewish stereotypes. According to the American Jewish Committee, it is \"often used in a benign and positive way and some may proudly declare themselves \\'philosemites\\' in affirmation of their allyship with the Jewish community\". \"However, some use the term to embrace or justify acceptance of stereotypical Jewish tropes like being adept with handling money, being well-connected to politicians, media, and other societal leaders, and more,\" the group says. Sky News has contacted the BBC and Olly Alexander for comment. The criticism comes amid calls for Israel to be dropped from the Eurovision Song Contest, with many citing Russia\\'s ban from the show.

Employees at the Hindley Street McDonald's, in Adelaide, reported 'almost daily' rat sightings to their union who sent a representative on December 8 to investigate. A new report published by SafeWork SA alleges that the rep was left waiting outside for 'an hour or two' after arriving at 12:15pm and eventually left. Workers at the diner have claimed that faulty wiring, falling ceiling tiles and the 'rat infestation' had created an unsafe work environment. A McDonalds spokesperson said that it is now in direct contact with the franchisee of the Hindley Street store regarding allegations made in the report. The Maccas on Hindley Street in Adelaide's CBD has been infested with rats for weeks, according to employees who have blown the whistle to the SDA (pictured rat in storage room) The workers allege that rats are seen 'almost daily' and that they have been caught 'nibbling' on the burger buns (pictured) One worker who wished to remain anonymous told The Advertiser that rat sightings and safety issues had become a normal part of the workplace.

The worker added that they once found a dead rat in the store and that photos had been taken of another rat nibbling cheese off of the floor in the storage area. Recently the kitchen also flooded due to a hole in the roof which workers were told to ignore and 'just keep working' through. Employees also complained of a lack of air-conditioning and inadequate supervision during weekend shifts. All of these concerns were reported to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) who sent a representative to confirm the allegations. The rep was initially denied entry by management at the store who asked them to wait 'for an hour or two' which the union deemed a 'refusal of entry'. SafeWork SA has confirmed that it was 'aware of the allegations and is conducting inquiries' of its own. A union representative was sent to investigate the allegations on December 8 but was refused entry by management at the rest (pictured) SDA secretary Josh Peak said that the restaurant had denied the union its 'legal right to investigate a rat infestation that was posing a risk to worker and consumer safety'. 'McDonald's should not be attempting to cover up health and safety concerns,' he said in a statement. 'Workers and consumers deserve to know that their workplaces and the products they sell are safe.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's stressed that the fast food chain took 'safety, cleanliness and hygiene very seriously'. '[We] and expect our restaurants to follow our strict cleaning, sanitisation and hygiene procedures at all times, including pest control,' they said. 'This clearly falls short of those standards, and we are addressing this directly with the franchisee and restaurant. 'McDonald's Australia [also] does not accept or condone 'anti-union' conduct within our business or franchisee-owned restaurants.'\\n\""

              "\"Agatha Christie's great-grandson has suggested she would have 'welcomed' the BBC's decision to change the race of the protagonist in the new adaptation of the crime writer's 1939 novel Murder is Easy. In the BBC's new series, the lead role of Luke Fitzwilliam - a retired police officer who investigates a serial killer in an English village- will be played by David Jonsson. The role had previously been played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a 2009 series. In 2022, Jonsson was named best actor at the Black British Theatre Awards and he previously appeared on the BBC's Industry and ITV's Endeavour. Previous changes to Christie's work for modern adaptations have occasionally provoked ire, however her great-grandson James Pritchard has said in general his ancestor appreciated 'radical adaptations of her work.' In the BBC's new series, the lead role of Luke Fitzwilliam will be played by David Jonsson (left) Agatha Christie's great-grandson has suggested she would have 'welcomed' changes to her work The novel concerns a retired police officer who investigates a serial killer in an English village Mr Pritchard, who is an executive producer for Agatha Christie Limited which holds the rights to her entire works, stressed that with all adaptions production companies had a 'degree of license to change things.' He told the Radio Times: 'I also believe these are adaptations, not translations, and you are always looking at the story from where you are now, 90 years after this was first written. How the BBC has changed Christie And Then There Were None - 2015 The BBC's three-part adaptation of Christie's most famous novel - in which ten people are murdered on an island - provoked anger due to mature content. The BBC's adaptation included several sex scenes and lude swearing not found in the novel. The Witness for the Prosecution - 2016 Fans were also left aghast when sex scenes and swearing were added to the material. The ABC Murders - 2018 In the mini series, John Malkovich played the role of Hercule Poirot. The adaptation contained references to the British Union of Fascists and Oswald Mosely that were not in the novel. Ordeal by Innocence - 2018 This mini series starred Bill Nighy in the role of Leo Argyll from the 1958 novel. In a shock twist, Nighy's character was made the murderer , despite the novel's original murderer being a female housekeeper.

Recent BBC adaptations of Christie's work have drawn the ire of some fans due to graphic content. In 2015, the BBC's three-part adaptation of Christie's most famous novel And Then There Were None provoked anger due to mature content. The BBC's adaptation included several sex scenes and lude swearing not found in the novel. TV writer Sarah Phelps, who wrote And Then There Were None amongst others, said that the changes were justified. Defending her creative decisions in 2020, Phelps said: 'Yes, of course I’ve taken liberties. Have I changed a load of stuff? Yeah, of course I have, loads and loads and loads of stuff. 'Otherwise you’d have 30 hours of TV and would you want to watch it? No. 'But, you always go for the beating heart of what she’s getting at.' In March this year, it was revealed that some of Christie's books were to be rewritten to eliminate verbiage that has been deemed insensitive or inappropriate. Several of the passages in the author's Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries were reportedly reworked or stripped altogether from new editions of the books. Publisher HarperCollins eliminated text containing 'insults or references to ethnicity', as well as descriptions of certain characters' physiques, The Telegraph reported. New editions of Ms Christie's novels, reviewed by the newspaper, showed that editors have made 'scores of changes' to her books. The novels, penned between 1920 and 1976, were stripped of sections of 'unsympathetic' dialogue, apparent insults and character descriptions. The BBC's new adaptation of Murder is Easy will be screened over the Christmas holidays The BBC's adaptation of and Then There Were None was criticised by some for mature content For example, the word 'Oriental' has been removed from her 1937 mystery Death on the Nile, which follows sleuth Hercule Poirot as he investigates a murder on a luxury cruise. The publisher changed dialogue of character of Mrs Allerton, who was complaining about pestering children. The original text said: 'They come back and stare, and stare, and their eyes are simply disgusting, and so are their noses, and I don’t believe I really like children.' The rewritten version reportedly reads: 'They come back and stare, and stare. And I don’t believe I really like children.' The publisher also eliminated the n-word from character dialogue and Ms Christie's prose. Ms Christie's novels have been altered in the past. Her 1939 book was retitled And Then There Were None after its original name featured a racist term.\\n\""

In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems. As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private. Many companies \\u201ctold me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns,\\u201d he said. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
