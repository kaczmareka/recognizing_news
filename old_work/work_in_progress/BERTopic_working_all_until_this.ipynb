Knight - wrote. 'Those who have been Following/Witnessing my journey here on Twa***r since 2011 all know that I have fought the good fight, but it seems that the haters, provocateurs and the Useful Idiots have won.' The Texas-born star also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I'm no longer interested in the back and forth regarding a \\\"color construct\\\" that keeps us human beings divided nor am I interested in politics or anything vitriolic. I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism.'

Washington went on to add: 'I am truly grateful for your support over the years. It looks like CORSICANA #CorsicanaMovie may be the last time you see me as an Actor born here in America.' He wrapped up his statement writing: 'Just know that I will be posting a few pictures of my retirement shenanigans here and there, but until then. Be safe out there. Your loved ones love you and need you. SALUTE!' Isaiah stars as Bass Reeves in the 2022 film Corsicana, which he says will be his last. He also directed and wrote the feature. The film follows former slave turned U.S. marshal who tracks an outlaw gang of killers to Corsicana, Texas. The thriller also stars Lew Temple, Stacey Dash and Noel Gugliemi. Washington rose to fame playing the highly skilled cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was an original cast member of the show, but was fired in 2007 following three seasons, after being accused of using a homophobic slur in reference to co-star T. R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set. He later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.'

He was fired in 2007 after using a homophobic slur against co-star T.R.

Knight, Patrick Dempsey, Justin Chambers, Katherine Heigl, and Chandra Wilson in 2005 promo shot In 2021 Isaiah opened up about his experiences on the Grey\\u2019s Anatomy set, and what he said were many toxic elements in play involving key figures on the ABC medical drama, in particular former leading man Patrick Dempsey. He spoke on KBLA Talk 1580 radio show saying that his firing 'was an agenda to cover up for the toxic and bad behavior of many of my former castmates on that show ... and the top of that would be Patrick Dempsey.' Washington said that his tension with Dempsey, 57, was initially based on finances. 'I was the highest paid person on that show, next to Patrick Dempsey,' he said. 'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that. 'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added. As of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad. 'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show. In 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist.

The e-commerce giant slaps the sum on returns made to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to the shopper's delivery address. But the sum is a relatively modest charge compared to other big brands which have increasingly begun implementing similar fees. T.J. Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively. In the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home. Now it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer. The move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year. It signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle. Returns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store. Figures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US. More generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales. This is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back. Returned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits. Last month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses. But the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices. Amazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's. It encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees. Amazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations H&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022 Amazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.' Zara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year. It was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported. The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime' Alexander now faces having the role stripped from him after he reportedly signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel an 'apartheid regime' Aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City on October 11 The letter which was allegedly signed by Alexander, who is non-binary and uses he/him pronouns, said: 'We are watching a genocide take place in real time. 'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.' Olly Alexander performing live on stage with his band Years and Years at Wembley Arena in 2022 Sir Elton John and Olly Alexander perform during The BRIT Awards 2021 at The O2 Arena The UK has won Eurovision five times, with the last time being in 1997 when Katrina & The Waves performed Love Shine A Light . Prior to that, the UK stormed to victory in 1981 with Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up, and in 1976 with Brotherhood Of Man's Save Your Kisses For Me. In 1969, Lulu, who performed Boom Bang-a-Bang came first in a four-way joint tie with France, the Netherlands and Spain. The UK's first ever Eurovision victory came 11 years after the annual competition launched with Sandie Shaw's Puppet on a String in 1967. Israel has won the competition four times after its debut in the competition in 1973 as the first non-European country to participate in the event. MailOnline has contacted Alexander's representatives for comment. The BBC declined to comment.\\n\""

However, regulators have already raised concerns about the potential impact of the acquisition on competition in the gaming industry. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union's (EU) antitrust watchdog have both launched probes into the proposed merger, with some analysts warning that it could lead to a reduction in choice for gamers. Despite these concerns, Amazon remains optimistic about the deal, citing the potential benefits of combining its vast gaming platform with Activision's popular franchises such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval."
