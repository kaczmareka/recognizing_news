              "\"The BBC's director-general has tried to calm tensions among staff over the Israel-Gaza war, telling them to think 'carefully about the language that you use' in the workplace. Tim Davie said employees needed to be 'kind' to each other and 'no one should ever face any fear or prejudice' at their place of work. His email to his workforce comes as one insider at the corporation reported there had been arguments between staff with different views on the Middle-East crisis. There have already been reports of how Jewish staff had been upset at the corporation's refusal to describe Hamas fighters as terrorists. But it has also been claimed that some of its own journalists believe the BBC has been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians. Yesterday in an apparent recognition of the tensions among staff, Mr Davie called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue. Mr Davie has called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue A mother covers her child's face to protect from the smoke as Palestinians leave from the northern part of the Gaza to flee the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip Admitting it had been a 'incredibly demanding' and 'stressful' time in recent weeks, he wrote: ' Our duty of care to all those impacted is paramount and I would ask everyone to be kind, considerate and supportive of each other. 'It is essential that we act with generosity and humanity, creating an environment where we look after each other in these troubled times, particularly those people most impacted by these awful events.' He added: 'No one should ever face any fear or prejudice in a workplace, and it requires all of us to pull together as one team to live our values. 'This can be harder in these polarised times but we should set the standard as an inclusive, safe environment. I would ask every one of you personally to contribute to this. 'This includes thinking carefully about the language that you use, in person, on email, and also on social media.' Mr Davie went on to provide details for staff who needed support as well as telling them they could use the corporation's whistleblowing services. A BBC source said: 'The BBC isn't some sort of monolithic organisation that doesn't have human beings. One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war 'There are people working in all sorts of parts of the world and people who like everyone else feels the stresses and strains in relation to covering a complex and difficult conflict.' One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war. Jewish staff already annoyed about the corporation's refusal to call Hamas fighters terrorists, were further upset when a John Simpson blog about this editorial decision referred to the Nazis. A recent report by The Times said staff who felt the corporation had been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians, had been left crying in the toilets, while freelancers had not turned up to work because of it. This comes as the corporation has been fiercely criticised for its coverage during the crisis. Senior figures in the Jewish community in the UK, including the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis have criticised the decision not to call Hamas terrorists. The president of Israel Isaac Herzog even attacked the BBC over this decision. The BBC also admitted that a controversial TV report about the cause of a Gaza hospital explosion had been flawed. In his staff email, Mr Davie paid tribute to its news teams saying 'those on the ground' had faced 'significant pressures' in doing their work.\\n\""
