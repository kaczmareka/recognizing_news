"People work in the Amazon Fulfillment Center in San Bernardino. A former employee sued, saying he was bullied an abused by co-workers at the facility. A former Amazon employee with Asperger’s syndrome claimed he was bullied and abused by co-workers at a warehouse in San Bernardino, and the company did nothing when he spoke up. Co-workers called him “retard,” “a waste of life,” and one person asked why he was working there “if you can’t do the job?” according to a lawsuit filed in court. A jury awarded the worker, Michael Kopp, $1.2 million earlier this month after finding that Amazon intentionally inflicted emotional distress on the former employee when its human resources department failed to stop the harassment. “Sadly what ended up happening is HR did nothing for months,” said Raymond Babaian, an attorney who represented Kopp. “As a result, [Kopp’s] fear and anxiety increased.” Attorneys representing Amazon in the suit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Amazon also did not immediately respond to inquiries about the ruling. Kopp, who has Asperger’s and dyslexia, was hired as a “warehouse associate” at Amazon’s Fulfillment Center in San Bernardino in Oct. 2015. At first, Kopp was hired on a temporary basis but was made full-time in March 2016, according to court records. Advertisement Business Pain, exhaustion rampant among Amazon warehouse workers, study says In a U.S. study, more than two-thirds of Amazon warehouse workers report taking unpaid time off to recover from pain or exhaustion sustained on the job. Because of his disorders, Kopp has difficulty with social interactions, nonverbal communication and difficulty reading, according to the initial complaint filed in February 2021. Despite those difficulties, Babaian said his client excelled in his job and, in 2019, was recognized as the third top associate in productivity for the entire facility. But his time at the company was also tainted with abuse, Babaian said, including verbal insults from co-workers and an employee who would throw boxes in Kopp’s direction. In one instance, an employee threw a 4-pound suit. When Kopp brought it up to a supervisor, the supervisor allegedly asked him not to report the incident, the lawsuit said. Babaian said his client tried to bring up his concerns to superiors several times but, because of his Asperger’s , he brought the incidents up as hypotheticals at first, he said. Kopp asked supervisors what to do if someone was “mean” to him, or what he should do if someone threw something at him. But according to the complaint, Kopp alleged the warehouse “seemed to operate much like a high school bullying the disabled kid.” After multiple incidents, Babaian said Kopp asked an assistant manager for help and filed a two-page complaint with the human resources department, detailing several of the incidents of harassment. However, he did not see any changes in response, and grew more worried the harassment would increase because of his complaint. Advertisement “He couldn’t handle the abuse any more and the fear of coming in to work,” Babaian said. “He tried asking for help.” Business Coming soon to your doorstep: Drone-delivered prescriptions from Amazon Amazon will soon make prescription drugs fall from the sky when the e-commerce giant becomes the latest company to test drone deliveries. Kopp believes he started having severe anxiety as a result. In one instance, after experiencing headaches and dizziness at work, an on-site nurse gave him a “sick bag” and told him to go back to work, according to the complaint. On Sept. 21, 2020, the complaint alleges Kopp went to see a doctor who believed his illness was stress-related, and gave him a note excusing him from work for a day. A manager and human resources representative, however, did not accept the note and told Kopp he had to report to work. Kopp alleges he experienced another anxiety attack, and did not return to work after Sept. 21, 2020. He was fired on Oct. 15, 2020 for job abandonment, according to the complaint. Kopp filed his lawsuit in February 2021, claiming the company intentionally inflicted emotional distress and allowed the conduct to occur. Another claim filed by Kopp alleging disability harassment did not get the necessary support of nine out of the 12 jurors — who instead voted 7 to 5 in Kopp’s favor — to approve the claim. Babaian said Kopp plans to file a retrial for that claim.

"A federal agency is seeking to force Starbucks to reopen 23 stores that were allegedly shuttered last year in order to discourage a nationwide union campaign. In a complaint issued on Wednesday by the National Labor Relations Board, it states that Starbucks closed the stores without prior notice to Workers United. Specifically, the agency claims that Starbucks shuttered cafes due to employees engaging in union activities. The agency is now seeking an order that would require Starbucks to immediately reopen the 23 stores and re-hire employees. States affected by the 23 closures include Washington, Colorado, California, Missouri and Illinois. Starbucks has denied any wrongdoing and said it respects workers' rights to choose whether to unionize. In a complaint issued on Wednesday by the National Labor Relations Board, it states that Starbucks closed the stores without prior notice to Workers United The agency claims that Starbucks shuttered cafes due to employees engaging in union activities. Employees and supporters are pictured here linking arms during a union party As well as reopening stores and re-hiring employees, the agency is asking the company to negotiate with stores that have unionized and provide compensation to workers who lost pay and benefits. The case will be heard by an administrative judge, whose decision can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and then to a federal appeals court. According to NBC Los Angeles, six cafes in southern California were referenced in the complaint. KUOW also reported that seven of the stores alluded to in the findings were all in Seattle, where the coffee giant is headquartered. The Philadelphia Inquirer also highlighted one store in the city that could be reopened. Other states affected by the 23 closures include Washington, Colorado, California, Missouri and Illinois A Starbucks representative told The New York Times: 'Each year, as a standard course of business, we evaluate the store portfolio' and typically open, close or alter stores.' The company told the paper it opened hundreds of new stores last year and closed more than 100, of which about three percent were unionized. The labor board has issued over 100 complaints covering hundreds of accusations of illegal behavior by Starbucks. Judges have ruled against the company over 30 times, but Starbucks have appealed these decisions. States affected by the 23 closures include Washington, Colorado, California, Missouri and Illinois States affected by the 23 closures include Washington, Colorado, California, Missouri and Illinois The complaint came on the same day that Starbucks released a report on its labor practices prepared by an independent consultant, which had been requested by shareholders. The report found that while there was room for Starbucks to improve its messaging on the union campaign, the company had not adopted 'an anti-union playbook' that involved violating U.S. labor laws. After two years of fighting the unionization of its U.S. stores, Starbucks last week said they were committed to bargaining to reach labor agreements next year. In a letter to Lynne Fox, the president of the Workers United union, Starbucks Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly said the current bargaining impasse between the two sides 'should not be acceptable to either of us.' Kelly asked to restart bargaining in January, writing: 'We will set as an ambition and hopeful goal the completion of bargaining and the ratification of contracts in 2024.' Workers United said the last bargaining session between the two sides was May 23 of this year. Last Saturday also marked the two-year anniversary of a Starbucks store in Buffalo voting to unionize, becoming the first store to join a union in over three decades. Since then, at least 370 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Currently there are about 9,600 company-owned Starbucks stores throughout the U.S. Unionizing workers say they're seeking higher pay, more consistent schedules and more say in issues like store safety and workload during busy times. Pictured: Starbucks Workers United protest outside of a Starbucks store in Dupont Circle in Washington D.C. In October, the company decided to sue Workers United in federal court and demanded they stop using the name Starbucks Workers United after that group posted a pro-Palestinian message on social media. Workers United countersued, saying Starbucks defamed the union by suggesting it supports violence. Starbucks said last week the lawsuit was proceeding. The change in stance from the company over its dealing with Workers United could be down to business reasons. The company reported record revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September, and its full-year revenue climbed nearly 12 percent to $35.9 Billion. Despite this, Starbucks stock has fallen 10 percent in the lost month, after 5,000 workers at more than 200 unionized stores went on strike. Placer.ai, an analytics company, said that after a strong fall, U.S. holiday visits to Starbucks appear to be down from a year ago.

"You might have seen a new energy drink on Amazon called Release. It had a catchy name, a sleek design and a bold font. But what you probably didn’t know is that it was actually part of a disgusting prank. Journalist Oobah Butler pulled it off for his new documentary, ""The Great Amazon Heist."" Butler is known for his outrageous stunts, like turning his shed into the top-rated restaurant on Tripadvisor. In his latest project, he exposes the supposed dark side of Amazon’s working conditions and how easy he claims it is to fool one of the world’s biggest companies. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER MORE: AMAZON SHOPPERS BRIBED TO LEAVE POSITIVE REVIEWS The warehouse nightmare allegations Butler’s investigation starts with him going undercover as a worker at an Amazon distribution center in Coventry, England. He wears a hidden camera and records what he claims is a grueling and unsafe environment for workers every day. He alleges he sees workers suffering from foot and back pain, working in hot and stuffy trucks and being constantly monitored by cameras and scanners. An Amazon spokesperson says that the company cares about employee safety and well-being and that it provides protective clothing and footwear and has health and safety teams on site. ARE YOU PROTECTED FROM THREATS? GET THE BEST ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION HERE Amazon drivers claim there’s not enough time for bathroom breaks After a few days, Butler gets recognized at the Amazon warehouse and switches his focus to the delivery drivers, who tell him even more shocking stories. They say they are under so much pressure to deliver packages on time that when they have to go to the bathroom, they urinate in bottles because they can’t afford to stop for breaks. Amazon denies this and says that its drivers receive reminders to take regular breaks on the Amazon Delivery app. MORE: IT'S TIME TO TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY WITH AMAZON The bathroom bottle problem The Amazon drivers Butler spoke with also claim that they get penalized for having those bottles in their truck when they return to the warehouse. To avoid this, the drivers allegedly end up throwing the bottles by the side of the road.

He gets his friends to buy the product and then cancels their orders. But he still manages to get Release to become the No. 1 bestseller in the Bitter Lemon category on Amazon. He says that he felt excited and scared when he saw real people trying to buy his product. Amazon has removed Release Energy from its site. The product was listed for a few days before it was taken down. An Amazon spokesperson says that this was a crude stunt and that Amazon has industry-leading tools to prevent genuinely unsafe products from being listed.

"The BBC's director-general has tried to calm tensions among staff over the Israel-Gaza war, telling them to think 'carefully about the language that you use' in the workplace. Tim Davie said employees needed to be 'kind' to each other and 'no one should ever face any fear or prejudice' at their place of work. His email to his workforce comes as one insider at the corporation reported there had been arguments between staff with different views on the Middle-East crisis. There have already been reports of how Jewish staff had been upset at the corporation's refusal to describe Hamas fighters as terrorists. But it has also been claimed that some of its own journalists believe the BBC has been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians. Yesterday in an apparent recognition of the tensions among staff, Mr Davie called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue. Mr Davie has called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue A mother covers her child's face to protect from the smoke as Palestinians leave from the northern part of the Gaza to flee the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip Admitting it had been a 'incredibly demanding' and 'stressful' time in recent weeks, he wrote: ' Our duty of care to all those impacted is paramount and I would ask everyone to be kind, considerate and supportive of each other. 'It is essential that we act with generosity and humanity, creating an environment where we look after each other in these troubled times, particularly those people most impacted by these awful events.' He added: 'No one should ever face any fear or prejudice in a workplace, and it requires all of us to pull together as one team to live our values. 'This can be harder in these polarised times but we should set the standard as an inclusive, safe environment. I would ask every one of you personally to contribute to this. 'This includes thinking carefully about the language that you use, in person, on email, and also on social media.' Mr Davie went on to provide details for staff who needed support as well as telling them they could use the corporation's whistleblowing services. A BBC source said: 'The BBC isn't some sort of monolithic organisation that doesn't have human beings. One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war 'There are people working in all sorts of parts of the world and people who like everyone else feels the stresses and strains in relation to covering a complex and difficult conflict.' One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war. Jewish staff already annoyed about the corporation's refusal to call Hamas fighters terrorists, were further upset when a John Simpson blog about this editorial decision referred to the Nazis. A recent report by The Times said staff who felt the corporation had been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians, had been left crying in the toilets, while freelancers had not turned up to work because of it. This comes as the corporation has been fiercely criticised for its coverage during the crisis. Senior figures in the Jewish community in the UK, including the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis have criticised the decision not to call Hamas terrorists. The president of Israel Isaac Herzog even attacked the BBC over this decision. The BBC also admitted that a controversial TV report about the cause of a Gaza hospital explosion had been flawed. In his staff email, Mr Davie paid tribute to its news teams saying 'those on the ground' had faced 'significant pressures' in doing their work.

"Amazon is running a competition to give its brokest staff 'trinkets' for Christmas while they toil in 'unsafe' conditions for peanuts. The delivery behemoth put up a flyer in its warehouses inviting workers to write a letter to Peccy, the company mascot, if they were struggling financially. 'Are you or someone you know facing financial hardship this holiday season? Peccy wants to help! Write a letter to Peccy,' the flyer read. 'If the Peccy team selects you, some of your holiday wishes could come true!' Peccy is a smiling orange amorphous blob whose name is short for the 'peculiar' way the company operates, according to its corporate jargon. Amazon put up a flyer in its warehouses inviting workers to write a letter to Peccy, the company mascot, if they were struggling financially Employees at Amazon's SWF1 facility in Rock Tavern, upstate New York, were outraged that the company was making them compete to be the worst off. This was particularly after Amazon tripled its profits to $9.9 billion for the three months to September 30, with sales of $143 billion. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is one of the richest people in the world with a $172.3 billion fortune, while his workers are paid as little as $17 an hour. Workers at the warehouse were already campaigning for safer working conditions, going on strike on Cyber Monday, the company's biggest day of the year. 'They basically say: ""Tell us about your hardships, how hard this holiday season is for you, [and] if we feel it's sad enough [then we'll] give your family some help"",' worker Keith Williams said. Williams said what workers really wanted was a living wage and decent conditions as they were being 'pushed past their limit'. 'All we're just asking for from Amazon is to do what they're clearly able to do with the billions of dollars that they have. We just want to share in some of the efforts that we do for Amazon. We want wages, not trinkets,' he said. Employees at Amazon's SWF1 facility in Rock Tavern, upstate New York, were already campaigning for safer working conditions, going on strike on Cyber Monday Workers picketed the factory on Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, to demand better pay and safer conditions Amazon said it understood the optics could be a lot better but insisted it was just trying to help out its staff. 'This was a well-intentioned holiday giving initiative that received a lot of positive feedback from employees,' it said. 'However, our team is aware of the potential negative perception it created and apologize to anyone who may have been offended.' Workers picketed the factory on Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, to demand better pay and safer conditions. 'We are fed up with Amazon putting its packages ahead of our safety,' Williams said. 'We are rallying and picketing today to show Amazon that we are the ones who make this company so valuable and we deserve respect.' Workers practiced walking a picket line, backed by local supporters, Teamsters semi-trucks, and a 'greedy pig' inflatable. 'The Hudson Valley is expensive and we can't afford decent housing on Amazon's low wages,' another worker, Thomas Walsh, said. Amazon tripled its profits to $9.9 billion for the three months to September 30, with sales of $143 billion 'I shouldn't have to choose which bills to pay each month and I can't imagine how tough it is for those with families. This trillion-dollar company can afford to pay us more.' Last year, SWF1 workers were injured at a rate of 6.3 per 100 full-time workers, higher than the national average for warehouses. Ninety-sever per cent of the injuries required workers to miss days or be on light duty. 'Amazon violates New York's Warehouse Worker Protection Act every day and specifically they are unclear about the unreasonable rates they make us work through,' a third worker, Taina Dominguez, said. 'With Cyber Monday and the holiday shopping season here, we are in danger unless we stand together and force Amazon to put our safety first.'

"Nihal Arthanayake says he saw 'a lack of diversity in my workplace over a long period of time,' weeks after the Radio 5 Live presenter said working at the 'overwhelmingly white' BBC was bad for his mental health. The 52-year-old presenter posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the 'lack of diversity' at the publicly-funded broadcaster was 'isolating and lonely'. Arthanayake also accused 'gbeebies [GB News] loving types' of making him out to be 'anti-white racist, adding: If a single one of them think I am going to be quiet they are even more stupid'. Speaking at the Journalism Diversity Fund (JDF) conference at BBC Media City in Salford last month, he said: 'I've seen a lot of people leave this building because they couldn't deal with the culture.' Arthanayake, who is of Sri Lankan descent, told the conference: 'It's really affecting me that I walk in and all I see is white people.' The 52-year-old presenter posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the ' lack of diversity' at the publicly-funded broadcaster had left him 'feeling isolated and lonely His colleagues' response when he told them this was to reply defensively that they were not being racist, he claimed as he said that was missing the point. The journalist's latest tweet was met with a strong backlash from some users who accused of him of being 'anti-white' and suggested that if the same comment came from the opposite perspective of white person, it would branded racist. The author of 'Let's talk: How to have better conversations', hit out at the criticism by posting: 'Racists calling me a racist is peak 2023 on this platform [X],' before urging his followers to follow him on rival platform Threads and 'leave these racists, bigots and blue tick warriors to argue amongst themselves and shout at me'. Pro-Brexit activist James Goddard said: If it’s isolating and lonely then go to Sri Lanka where you’ll feel at home. The British people were never asked if we wanted millions of foreigners in our country. 'If we were asked, we wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in today with anti white racists like you being given a platform to spout your hate'. One user said that if the presenter felt isolated and that he was bring treated differently, he could have raised a grievance but if his complaint is down to skin colour only, then its a reflection of his prejudice. But Arthanayake responded by saying: 'Some white people have been seeing our colour and treating us accordingly ever since we got here'. Other users came to show their support of Arthanayake, such as Michael Volpe OBE, founder & former CEO of Opera Holland Park, who posted on X: 'The relentless racism that [LBC presenter] Sangita Myska, Nihal Arthanayake and [Lingo presenter] Adil Ray - 3 prominent British broadcasters get tells a depressing story. Nihal Arthanayake says he saw 'a lack of diversity in my workplace over a long period of time' The journalist's latest tweet was met with a strong backlash from some users who accused of him of being 'anti-white' Presenter said his colleagues' response when he told them this was to reply defensively that they were not being racist, he claimed as he said that was missing the point 'Basically if your skin is not white, for too many people you will NEVER be English/British. My skin is white and I will never be British either'. At the JDF's conference last month, Arthanayake said: 'I don't think there's a single Muslim involved in the senior editorial processes' at BBC Radio 5 Live. He added: 'The hardest thing is to walk into a room, look around and nobody looks like you.' The presenter made the comments in an on-stage interview with Jo Adetunji, editor of The Conversation, at the JDF's annual equality, diversity and inclusion conference organised by the NCTJ, which trains new journalists. The JDF awards bursaries to aspiring journalists from diverse backgrounds who do not have the financial means to support themselves through their training. Arthanayake added that he has noticed a difference since moving north after living in London for 20 years. He said: 'Since moving up here, being called the P-word – that didn't happen in London. 'You'd get a slap for that in London, not even from me.' Following the interview, Cheryl Varley, a BBC Radio 5 Live producer, said the organisation is committed to tackling the lack of diversity in its newsrooms. After inviting the JDF bursary recipients for a tour of the newsroom at the end of the conference, she told them: 'The BBC needs you a lot more than you need them because if we do not represent our audience the future for the BBC is grim.' The MailOnline has approached the BBC for comment.

"The BBC has been slammed after it emerged it is spending more than £600,000 a year on staff responsible for 'diversity and inclusion'. The corporation employs 15 members of staff in roles which relate to 'diversity, equity or inclusion' a Freedom of Information request found. Some of these are part-time positions, meaning in total their jobs are equivalent to that of 13 people in full-time employment. The BBC did not give a precise total for the cost but did provide salary ranges for the jobs. Based on these figures the lowest estimate for their total cost per year is £678,071 and the upper £1,116,796, The Sunday Telegraph reported. The positions include that of a 'creative diversity partner' paid between £50,481 and £85,470 per year - which sounds as though it could have been a role in mockumentary TV series W1A, which satirises management of the BBC. Actress Nina Sosanya played Lucy Freeman who was 'Head of Inclusivity' in the comedy. The BBC employs 15 members of staff in roles which relate to 'diversity, equity or inclusion' a Freedom of Information request found Conservative MP Gareth Johnson said: 'It's so depressingly unsurprising from the BBC. They seem to be obsessed with wokeness rather than programme making' Critics say the spending is an example of the corporation wasting licence fee payer money on 'woke nonsense'. The BBC says it expects the production teams it works with 'to be at least 20 per cent diverse'. It also wants 'at least two individuals in senior decision-making roles' on a production to 'be from one of the three under-represented groups: which include black or minority ethnic, disabled and working class. Sir John Hayes, the Conservative MP for South Holland and The Deepings told The Mail: 'Given the BBC's patchy record it's about time it dropped all this stuff and concentrated on what the viewers and listeners really want which is high-quality programming. 'I think diversity and inclusivity sounds good in theory but in practice it's used as a vehicle for all kinds or horrors.' Conservative MP Gareth Johnson added: 'It's so depressingly unsurprising from the BBC. They seem to be obsessed with wokeness rather than programme making. 'If the BBC spent a little more time concentrating on programme making and a little less time on being woke we would have better quality production from them. 'It's astonishing the BBC spends so much money on diversity yet still gets so much wrong over the Israel/Hamas conflict.' Rupert Lowe, of Reform UK, said: 'It's time to defund the BBC, free the licence fee payer of their legal obligation to prop up this woke nonsense' Rupert Lowe, a spokesman for Reform UK, said: 'The BBC was founded on the noble principles of informing, educating and entertaining - it now achieves none of them. 'This is just another in a long line of failures, which demonstrate the broadcaster is no longer fit for purpose. It's time to defund the BBC, free the licence fee payer of their legal obligation to prop up this woke nonsense and let the public decide if they wish to financially support such a rotten monopoly. 'I suspect the answer will be a resounding no.' Toby Young, of the Free Speech Union, said: 'What 'diversity' means at the BBC is people that look different but all think the same way. It means a privately educated daughter of an African diplomat who is pro-Palestinian and anti-Brexit is much more likely to get a job than a white working-class man who voted Leave and wants to call Hamas a terrorist organisation.' It comes after the corporation faced criticism over its decision to feature a transgender woman on its annual 100 Women list for 2023. Critics claimed the decision to include activist Rukshana Kapali on the roll call of 'inspiring', 'influential' women rendered the list 'meaningless'. Among the women from various fields named on this year's list were Michelle Obama and Amal Clooney. Describing the 24-year-old Nepalese-born Kapali as a 'housing campaigner' and a 'transgender human rights activist', the BBC said she had 'embarked on her own path of self-education around the diversity of gender and sexuality' and had been 'vocal on social media on issues around queer rights'. well with women's rights activists and others. But women's rights campaigners said her inclusion took away a place for a biological woman. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC, just like most organisations, has staff working to ensure we reflect the diverse communities of the UK, both on and off screen. 'Diversity and inclusion is part of the BBC's public purposes as set out in its Charter. We will continue to deliver on our plans, balancing the need to attract and retain highly skilled staff while offering value for licence fee payers.'

"The boss of Aviva has revealed senior white male recruits have to get a final sign-off from her and the chief people officer as part of the firm's drive to improve diversity. Amanda Blanc, who became the insurer's first female chief executive in 2020, said the policy formed part of its efforts to end sexism in the financial services industry. The 56-year-old told MPs on the Treasury select committee that 'there is no non-diverse hire at Aviva without it being signed off by me and the chief people officer'. Speaking at the Sexism in the City inquiry yesterday, she continued: 'Not because I don't trust my team but because I want to make sure that the process followed for that recruitment has been diverse, has been properly done and is not just a phone call to a mate to say, 'would you like a job, pop up and we'll fix it up for you'.' Sources told MailOnline that if the preferred candidate for a senior role at the firm is not diverse - meaning they are 'not different to the majority of people' employed by Aviva - then Mrs Blanc and the chief people officer check the recruitment process. It is also understood that the company prioritises finding the best candidate for the job, but they also want to recruit a diverse workforce. Some 5 per cent of the firm's overall roles are for senior leaders and 60 per cent of its senior leaders are men. Mrs Blanc was speaking only about senior hires at Aviva, which has 22,000 staff overall. Amanda Blanc became the first female chief executive of the insurer Aviva in 2020 During the hearing yesterday Mrs Blanc, who also sits on BP's board, warned that sexism in the financial services sector is worse than in wider society.

Mrs Blanc, who lives in Hampshire with her husband Ken and has two daughters aged 21 and 17, added: 'We are dealing with a societal issue that is definitely amplified in financial services.' She was speaking to the Treasury committee as part of the third public hearing of its sexism inquiry, which was launched after a flurry of harassment allegations rocked the business world. Mrs Blanc revealed that women from across the industry had been writing to her in recent days as she prepared for the hearing, sharing 'absolutely appalling' accounts of harassment, including unwanted sexual advances, being followed into hotel rooms, or being told their pregnancies were 'inconvenient' for the firm. The testimonies also included evidence of women being excluded from key meetings and overlooked for promotions. The City is under fresh scrutiny after a string of controversies this year, including scandals at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and a flurry of claims brought against hedge fund manager Crispin Odey. Her comments also came on the same day that former BP boss Bernard Looney was forced to forfeit £32.4million after he committed 'serious misconduct' over relationships with colleagues. Mrs Blanc said Aviva, which is based in the City of London, had acted to sack male employees for inappropriate behaviour. Mrs Blanc spoke to the Treasury select committee for the Sexism in the City inquiry yesterday She told MPs: 'Every individual firm has to be accountable for any allegations such as this, and the women in the firm have to know that there is a process for speaking up; that that process will be acted on; that everything will be investigated; and that the person who did the bad leaves the organisation, not the women.

Politicians said they had been 'extremely shocked' by private testimony they had also heard from women working in finance about sexual assault, harassment, bullying and a culture that allows perpetrators impunity. Labour MP Angela Eagle said 'a series of well-known bad apples that nobody ever does anything about' continued to operate in the industry. She did not name names. Mrs Blanc is known for being a pioneer in male-dominated sectors, holding a string of senior roles in insurance and chairing the Professional Rugby Board for Wales until she stepped down in 2021. She also spoke about Aviva's infamous annual general meeting last year when one investor complained that she was not 'the man for the job'. She reiterated that the comments were 'unacceptable'. Mrs Blanc added that physical and verbal harassment of women in financial services eclipsed other industries and that she had heard 'absolutely appalling' stories. She said she had posted a message on LinkedIn before appearing before MPs and had been 'inundated' by private messages from women about 'predominantly poor experiences'. Amanda Blanc laughs with Kate Middleton at a Business Taskforce for Early Childhood meeting in London on March 21 'I have been in the situation where I have had a pregnancy test in one hand and a job offer in the other, and a boss who says: 'You still join',' she said. 'However, many women do not ... The women in a firm need to know there is a process for speaking up, that that process will be acted on, that everything will be investigated and that the actual person who did the (wrong) will leave the organisation, not the woman.' Mrs Blanc is the champion of a government Women in Finance Charter initiative that is pushing for equal gender representation. She said that the scale of verbal and physical abuse in finance firms surveyed last year was 10 percentage points higher than in other industries, at 43 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. Perpetrators of predatory behaviour needed to leave the business, she said. Mrs Blanc revealed that women from across the industry had been writing to her in recent days Mrs Blanc added that the more subtle misconduct of excluding women from promotion or meetings, and snide comments that prevented them from speaking up, was often about management. 'The scope of the charter is to get more women into senior management roles,' she said. 'My belief is if you have more women in senior management roles, this behaviour will go away.' The Treasury select committee's inquiry has also heard evidence of ongoing discrimination and harassment in the industry, as well as a persistently high pay gap. Fund management grandee Baroness Morrissey told the committee in October that sexism was 'endemic' across financial services and is still run by an 'old boys' network'. She called for independent reviews into how firms deal with complaints of sexual harassment, adding that watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, could better use its powers to tackle the problem - including penalising firms for failing to act.

The 270-year-old institution will receive the money over 10 years to help with the masterplan renovation of the museum’s Bloomsbury site which will include an overhaul of its electrical and plumbing systems. Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the British Museum’s masterplan committee, said the grounds were in urgent need of renovation and he was grateful to BP for its support. But environmental campaigners have slammed the partnership as “completely indefensible” and out of touch with ordinary Britons. Greenpeace claimed the deal was “brazen greenwashing” and should be terminated. Extinction Rebellion protesters hold a ‘Drop BP’ sign inside the British Museum in April 2022 (PA) Mr Mayfield said: “The British Museum is one of the largest and most visited cultural institutions in the world but some of its buildings are over 200 years old and in urgent need of refurbishment.” “That’s why the masterplan is so essential – and it’s exciting to be moving forward with our plans. There’s so much to look forward to in 2024 and we are grateful to all our partners for their support.” It comes after the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate previously cut ties with the company over concerns about climate change. Environmental group Culture Unstained, which campaigns for ending oil sponsorship of culture in the UK, told The Independent: “This is an astonishingly out of touch and completely indefensible decision. “We believe this decision is illegitimate and in breach of the museum’s own climate commitments and will be seeking legal advice in order to mount a formal challenge to it.” Greenpeace added: “No cultural establishment that has a responsibility to educate and inform should be allowing fossil fuel companies to pay them to clean their image, not least the British Museum,” Greenpeace UK’s policy director Doug Parr said. Louise Kingham, BP senior vice-president, said: “We are proud to be a long-term partner to this important British institution and play our part in its future transformation.”

"Carbon removal solutions provider Carbonfuture announced today a new offtake agreement with Microsoft for biochar carbon removal (BCR) credits, in collaboration with the Bolivia-based Exomad Green Concepción project. Set to deliver more than 32,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits to Microsoft by June 2024, the deal marks one of the largest-to date BCR purchase agreements. Carbonfuture CEO Hannes Junginger-Gestrich said: “Our collaboration with Microsoft and Exomad is a positive step forward for the carbon removal industry and represents a critical step in accelerating the transition to a sustainable, net-zero future. Carbonfuture’s approach, rooted in transparency and quality, ensures high-integrity carbon removal.” Biochar, or biological charcoal, is produced by heating biomass, such as forest residue, wood or crop waste, in the absence of oxygen, creating a stable form of carbon, which when buried in soil enables centuries-long carbon sequestration, in addition to leading to improved soil fertility. Exomad Green’s facility transforms forestry waste into biochar. By utilizing biomass that would otherwise have been burnt, the project is expected to generate benefits in addition to carbon management, including reducing health and fire risks, mitigating deforestation through sustainable timber management practices, in addition to bolstering farming practices in indigenous communities by enhancing soil fertility through biochar. Diego Justiniano, CEO of Exomad Green said: “The Exomad Green project with Carbonfuture and Microsoft is more than just a carbon removal initiative; it’s a testament to our commitment to environmental sustainability and community empowerment. We’re proud to contribute to a solution that not only addresses global carbon challenges but also tangibly enhances the lives of local communities in Bolivia while contributing to the reduction in deforestation linked to soil degradation.” The agreement marks the latest in a series of carbon removal announcements by Microsoft, forming part of the company’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, and to remove all of its historical emissions by 2050, spanning a wide range of technologies and approaches, including nature-based reforestation projects, direct air capture (DAC) solutions, and ocean-based carbon removal, as well as another recent biochar-based agreement. In its recently-published Carbon Removal briefing paper, Microsoft described Biochar as “the mainstay of our medium-durability portfolio and plans” for carbon removal, “that bridges the durability and cost gap” between shorter-duration solutions such as afforestation, and longer-duration but higher cost solutions such as DAC. Brian Marrs, Senior Director, Energy & Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:

"Unilever is under investigation over claims it is misleading customers by exaggerating how 'green' its products are. The FTSE 100 consumer goods giant, whose brands include Dove soap, Magnum ice-cream and Lynx deodorant, is facing a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into so-called 'greenwashing'. The investigation is a major embarrassment for Unilever, which is well-known for brandishing its woke credentials. It has claimed its Hellmann's mayonnaise serves a 'purpose' beyond adorning salads and sandwiches while it has also suggested its Lux soap can help women rise above misogyny. This has led to criticism in some quarters, not least from investors, with fund manager Terry Smith last year saying it has 'lost the plot' over its focus on social issues. Unilever, whose brands include Dove soap and Lynx deodorant is facing a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority into 'greenwashing' And its do-good approach has put the company in the crosshairs of regulators. CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said: 'More and more people are trying to do their bit to help protect the environment, but we're worried many are being misled by so-called 'green' products that aren't what they seem. 'So far, the evidence we've seen has raised concerns about how Unilever presents certain products as environmentally friendly. 'We'll be drilling down into these claims to see if they measure up. If we find they're greenwashing, we'll take action.' A Unilever spokesman said: 'We are surprised and disappointed with the CMA's announcement and refute that our claims are in any way misleading. We will continue to co-operate with the CMA and fully comply with further requests for information.' The regulator is stepping up scrutiny of companies that may be exaggerating their green credentials in an attempt to woo climate-conscious consumers, as well as attracting billions of dollars from environmentally focused investor funds. The CMA launched a wider probe in January, joining regulators in the US and Europe as they crack down on potentially false environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) claims made by companies. The CMA will look at how 'green claims' made by Unilever stack up and said it was concerned about 'the use of vague and broad claims, unclear statements around recyclability, and natural looking images and logos'. Images such as 'green leaves' may mislead consumers into thinking certain products are more eco-friendly than they actually are, it said. The probe is likely to be particularly embarrassing for former boss Alan Jope who four years ago warned that 'woke-washing is beginning to infect our industry' as he took aim at firms that do not 'walk the talk' on ethical points. Unilever is now facing an investigation into the very thing Jope spoke out against. Danni Hewson of broker AJ Bell said: 'A huge amount of money is spent on household goods every year and whilst people want to do their bit, they don't want to be taken for a ride – especially if they've been prepared to shell out a little extra in order to do the right thing.'

"Amazon is considering an expansion into veterinary telehealth in its latest bid to compete with Walmart , which began offering the service to Walmart+ subscribers earlier this year, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The e-commerce giant, which has already expanded into human health with its acquisition of One Medical, is a dominant player in pet food and supplies. But it has not so far meaningfully invested in pet health, which is expected to drive growth in the $137 billion pet market. The people who discussed Amazon's consideration of the vet service declined to be named because the discussions are private. Veterinary telehealth allows pet parents to have virtual appointments with veterinarians and veterinary technicians. The service is similar to human telemedicine. Earlier this year, Walmart signed a deal with veterinary telehealth provider Pawp to offer Walmart+ subscribers free access to the startup's membership for a year. The offering is set to expire Nov. 19, less than a week before Black Friday and right around the time the pet holiday shopping season begins. Amazon could turn to Pawp to fuel a potential pet telehealth offering in time for the holiday season because Pawp has already proven it can scale with a large retailer. Amazon could also partner with one of the dozens of other pet telehealth startups on the market or build its own practice, which is what Chewy did when it began offering the service during the Covid pandemic. As Amazon's efforts to expand its health-care business show mixed results, the company has signaled that the pet market is a priority. Earlier this year, it spent big on a heartwarming Super Bowl ad that featured a rescue dog and how its family turned to Amazon when it needed supplies. Amazon declined to comment.

The UKs largest supermarket chain said the warning applies to its Tesco Finest Apple & Cranberry Stuffing Mix (130g), with a best before date of September 2024. “We are recalling a single batch of Tesco Finest Apple & Cranberry Stuffing Mix due to the possible presence of moths which makes the product unfit for human consumption,” the official recall notice said. Tesco apologised to its customers as it issued a recall warning (Food Standards Agency ) A risk assessment, shared by the Food Standards Agency, said: “This product has a presence of insects (moths), which makes it unsafe to eat.” In a message to customers, the chain said: “Please do not consume this product and return it to store where a full refund will be given. No receipt is required. “Tesco apologises to our customers for any inconvenience caused.” The warning message shared by the supermarket chain made no mention of how moths could have ended up in a Christmas stuffing product. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is an independent government department responsible for public health in relation to food. If there is a problem with a food product which should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' or 'recalled'. The FSA issues withdrawal notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems with food. The Independent has contacted Tesco for comment.

"An independent contractor wearing a protective mask and gloves loads Amazon Prime grocery bags into a car outside a Whole Foods Market in Berkeley, California, on Oct. 7, 2020. Amazon is piloting a new grocery subscription for members of its Prime program, the company said Thursday, marking the latest recalibration of its online supermarket offerings. Members of the company's Prime program will have the option to pay $9.99 per month to get unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh on orders more than $35. They'll also have access to 30-minute pickup on orders of any size. To start, the service is rolling out in Denver, Colorado; Sacramento, California; and Columbus, Ohio. ""We're always experimenting with features to make shopping easier, faster, and more affordable, and we look forward to hearing how members who take advantage of this offer respond,"" Tony Hoggett, who leads Amazon's physical stores business, said in a statement. Amazon is betting Prime members will want to pay an additional monthly charge for fresh food to be dropped at their doorstep without pesky delivery fees. A Prime subscription costs $139 per year, or $14.99 per month, in the U.S., and the membership's perks include free, speedy shipping and access to video streaming. With the add-on grocery subscription, the offering could drive bigger, and more frequent, food orders among Prime members. Amazon has tweaked its fee-free delivery threshold for Fresh and Whole Foods orders in recent years amid mounting costs. In October, the company lowered its threshold for free Fresh grocery delivery to orders over $100, after setting the minimum at $150 months earlier. In 2021, the company introduced a $10 service fee for Whole Foods delivery orders to Prime members. Prior to the fee changes earlier this year, the company offered free Amazon Fresh grocery delivery on orders above $35 at no extra cost for Prime members. Amazon has been determined to cement itself as a grocery destination for shoppers. Since acquiring Whole Foods Market in 2017 for $13.7 billion, it has launched its own chain of Fresh supermarkets, and it's taken steps more recently to unify its online and brick-and-mortar grocery operations, while appealing to a broader swath of consumers. Last month, the company opened Fresh grocery delivery to people without Prime anywhere in the U.S., after testing the feature in a handful of cities.  Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:

"The head of Canada's biggest grocery chain says the looming implementation of the grocery code of conduct would lead to higher prices for consumers, not lower ones. Speaking at a House of Commons agriculture committee meeting on Thursday morning on stabilizing food prices, Galen Weston, executive chairman of the Loblaws group of companies, said his company and the industry at large have been unfairly targeted for food price inflation. He says Loblaws has been an ""active participant in discussions with government"" on the topic of food prices, and noted that the company has ""meaningfully"" reduced its prices on staple items that make up about 10 per cent of its chain-wide sales. ""This is on top of super low everyday pricing and our discount stores where we routinely sell products like bananas, sugar, and milk all below cost,"" he said. ""We know if we do not provide real value, customers will shop elsewhere."" Parliamentarians grilled Weston and Walmart Canada CEO Gonzalo Gebara on the topic of grocery prices, and a frequent topic of inquiry was the grocery code of conduct — a draft proposal that has been in the works for years meant at codifying some ground rules for how retail chains interact with their suppliers. Other food retailers and some manufacturers have expressed their support for the code, but Loblaws and Walmart have been more reticent. In Loblaws' case, Weston said they are concerned about a number of clauses in the code that could increase their cost of doing business and in fact make retail prices higher, not lower, as some people are hoping it will. Tell us what you think! Help shape the future of CBC article pages by taking a quick survey. Take Survey ""As the code is currently drafted our strong conviction is that it will raise prices,"" Weston said. ""The principle is fine, but the way it's drafted is what we have an issue with."" Weston outlined a series of specific details within the proposed code that he takes issue with, including a dispute resolution mechanism than gives control to an outside third party. Another section governing written contracts between retailers and their suppliers is problematic for Loblaws, as is a section concerning various charges that suppliers are levied for services like stocking, listing, position, promotions, marketing costs, unsellables and shrinkage that they have to pay to have their wares make it on to the store shelf in the first place. Lastly, Loblaws objects to another clause in the proposed code that governs whether or not retailers are allowed to charge suppliers a fee when they reject an order because they can't fill the requested size of the order. While Weston conceded that Loblaws would abide by the terms of any officially enacted code, he says as currently constructed it will do nothing to bring down grocery prices. ""We are here being held accountable for high food prices that are not the direct responsibility of the grocery industry,"" he said. ""Now you're asking us to sign onto something that we believe in our bones is going to do the opposite of what other people say it's going to do."" WATCH | Here's what grocery CEOs said about pricing in an earlier appearance in Ottawa: Grocery chain leaders push back at price-gouging allegations Duration 4:12 At a committee hearing in Ottawa this week, the heads of Loblaw, Metro and Empire Foods faced tough questions from parliamentarians about why food prices continue to skyrocket. All three pushed back forcefully against allegations they are profiteering from high inflation. Gebara with Walmart struck a similar tone. ""We want to make sure the code has all of the different provisions and conditions so that we can conduct our business to offer low prices every day for our customers across Canada,"" he said. ""We believe that the code is not in a position for us to commit to signing."" Other food retailers including Metro and Sobey's have been more publicly supportive of the code. Speaking at the same committee on Monday, Sobeys head Michael Medline says his company has been actively supporting the implementation of a grocery code of conduct for more than three years. ""Although we are ready, willing and able to sign the code today, we now have serious doubts as to whether the code will actually come into effect due to recent opposition by some retailers. In no way do we believe, nor does evidence show, that a grocery code of conduct would lead to higher food prices or less choice for Canadians. In fact, quite the opposite,"" Medline said. Code will level the playing field: independent grocers Gary Sands, vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers, told the committee on Monday that the code is required to level the playing field between the major players like Loblaws and the almost 7,000 smaller grocers he represents, because they don't have the same leverage to demand lower prices, and often have to pay more because suppliers need to offset concessions they've had to give elsewhere. ""We don't point our fingers at our supplier partners, we understand the pressures that are driving up their cost,"" he told the committee. ""An independent grocer has no leverage to demand a price freeze or a drop in price."" He says the code is good for everyone because it will get rid of ""distorted market practices ... and onerous fees imposed by some large retailers."" ""This code is not a document comprised of overly prescriptive regulations, but simply a straightforward set of principles of good behaviour developed by industry itself. It won't increase food prices, as Loblaws has claimed — no one in industry would support any measure that would do that."" Michael Graydon, CEO of the Food, Health & Consumer Products of Canada association and chairman of the interim board of directors of steering committee drafting the code, has pushed back on the notion that it will raise prices for consumers. ""We just don't believe that that's true,"" he said last month. The federal and Quebec agriculture and food ministers are calling on all members of the grocery industry supply chain to sign onto a code of conduct. Federal Minister Lawrence MacAulay and Quebec Minister Andre Lamontagne said they're disappointed to see the grocery code of conduct has still not been launched after years of work. They're also disappointed that ""supply chain partners are hesitant to move forward"" with signing on to the voluntary code, the ministers said in a statement Thursday.

"ALDI has been blasted after staff were filmed throwing away excess food with the 'wasteful' move angering both customers and charities. Workers were filmed throwing out fruit and vegetables into an over-filled skip bin at Townsville's new ALDI store, just three days after opening at the end of November. In the 20 second video, two ALDI staff members were seen tossing what appeared to be pumpkins, cabbages and carrots, whilst another worker looked on. They didn't appear to slow down, and one even had an item in each hand to throw the vegetables in at the same time to be more efficient. The over-filled skip was full over produce, such as carrots, pumpkins and cabbages The sheer volume of wasted produce could be seen in the skip which was filled to the brim. Given the current cost-of-living crisis and the fast approaching festive season, residents were furious to see food waste on such a large scale. Meanwhile, local food charities in Townsville are struggling to keep up with demand, working overtime to make sure locals in need have enough food for Christmas. 'It distresses me a bit to know that there is food being wasted like that,' Townsville Food Pantry manager Tricia Hatfield told the ABC. She said the food charity would have happily taken the excess fruit and vegetables ALDI had discarded. 'We collect from several supermarkets during the week. What we get is stored in a cold room for refrigeration. It goes to people first and if that's not suitable it will go to a farmer,' she said. An ALDI spokesman told Daily Mail Australia there had been a large volume of produce ordered for the new store. Two workers were seen tossing produce away with one local food bank manager describing it as 'distressing' 'As we open in new markets, there is always a learning curve, and it was clear the produce estimate for this new store was incorrect resulting in an unfortunate amount of waste,' he said. 'ALDI takes its responsibility to reduce food waste very seriously and has processes and policies in place to ensure that minimal amounts of products on our shelves end up as waste.' After realising the produce order was too large, ALDI said they worked with their local food partner 'to minimise the waste, donating produce until local demand had been met, and our food waste partner could no longer accept any further donations.' ALDI said there are now measures implemented to help 'minimise waste levels in this store including working to expand our food donation network in Townsville as we establish our store and community in this new location.'

She said she notified a flight attendant that her son suffered from a severe peanut allergy, according to ABC News. She told Good Morning America that she asked the flight attendant to alert people in the surrounding rows to be careful with their snacks. ""I went up to speak to the flight attendant and I said, 'My son has a life-threatening peanut allergy.

In fact, I was approaching it with a very optimistic view and the opposite happened,"" she said. She said that she was met with an icier response on her return trip, claiming a United staffer was rude to her when she made the request.

"Federal prosecutors in Switzerland charged a unit of commodity trading powerhouse Trafigura with bribing an Angolan official connected to the oil and gas industry. The charges cite Trafigura’s inadequate compliance program and organizational failures, and set out corporate compliance standards under Swiss law. The Office of the Attorney General announced the charges against privately-held Trafigura in a criminal indictment last week. Also charged were the firm’s former chief operating officer, an intermediary that acted for Trafigura in Angola, and an Angolan official. Trafigura paid more than $6 million in bribes between 2009 and 2011, according to the indictment, and made profits of more than $143 million on contracts secured by the bribes. Details of the charges against Trafigura in the Swiss prosecutor’s release come under the heading “Alleged lack of organization.” The indictment accuses Trafigura of “failing to take, between April 2009 and October 2011, all reasonable and necessary organizational measures to prevent the commission, within the company, of offenses of bribery of foreign public officials” as required by Swiss law. Trafigura’s compliance practices allegedly didn’t meet “international standards on preventing and combating corruption” and weren’t “apt to prevent the high risk of corruption” associated with Trafigura’s activities in the petroleum industry in Angola, the Attorney General’s statement said. Prosecutors said Trafigura’s risk was “all the greater given that the [company] was involved with an Angolan state-owned company and resorting to intermediaries to develop its business in that country.” In addition, Trafigura’s due diligence and monitoring of the intermediaries’ activities weren’t “effectively implemented.” Trafigura’s “disorganization” made the bribery of foreign public officials possible, the Attorney General’s release said. In a statement last week about another corruption-related matter, Trafigura said it expects to resolve a U.S. DOJ investigation into “improper payments made in Brazil shortly.” The firm said it has reserved $127 million for the U.S. resolution. According to FCPA Tracker, in December 2020, Trafigura disclosed accusations by authorities in Brazil of “improper conduct in respect of certain historic transactions with Petrobras in 2012-13.” Petrobras is Brazil’s state oil and gas company. Trafigura said at the time that it “strongly denies these allegations.” It said its management “actively promotes a culture of transparency and regulatory compliance” and that its “bribery and corruption policies and compliance systems . . . meet international standards.” In a statement last week concerning the Swiss charges, Trafigura CEO Jeremy Weir said: We sincerely regret these incidents which breached our code of conduct and are contrary to our values. We have made extensive efforts over many years to instill a culture of responsible conduct at Trafigura. Since the period in question, we have significantly enhanced our compliance program and controls. This includes mandatory training for all staff, ongoing investment in a global compliance team and our decision in 2019 to prohibit the use of third parties for business origination. Our compliance policies and procedures have been externally reviewed and found to meet relevant legal requirements and international good practice standards. These historical incidents in no way represent the company we are today. Trafigura said Friday it made a net profit for the year of $7.4 billion on revenue of $244 billion. It said it will pay partners a $5.9 billion dividend. In a similar case in 2019, the Swiss federal prosecutor convicted commodities trading firm Gunvor. Prosecutors charged Guvnor with “failing to take all the organizational measures that were reasonable and necessary to prevent its employees and agents from bribing public officials in order to gain access to the petroleum markets in the Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast.” Geneva-based Guvnor paid about $95 million in fines and penalties following its criminal conviction.

"Baroness Michelle Mone has admitted she made an 'error' in denying her links to the PPE Medpro firm being investigated by the National Crime Agency - and she now struggles to sleep and suffers panic attacks over the scandal. The Conservative peer and Ultimo bra tycoon launched a public defence today over the controversy surrounding 'VIP lane' contracts during the coronavirus pandemic. PPE Medpro was awarded Government contracts worth more than £200 million to supply personal protective equipment after she recommended it to ministers. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has since issued breach of contract proceedings over the 2020 deal on the supply of gowns. Lady Mone spoke in a documentary aired today to say she and her husband Doug Barrowman will be cleared because 'we've done nothing wrong'. But she did admit her 'regret' in not being upfront about her links to the PPE company straight away, saying she made an 'error'. The Baroness went on to say she suffers from panic attacks and nightmares about the NCA 'crashing through the house' and she sees them standing over her bed. Baroness Michelle Mone (pictured) spoke for the first time today in a YouTube documentary about the controversy surrounding 'VIP lane' contracts Lady Mone spoke of her 'regret' in not being upfront about her links to the PPE company Lady Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman (pictured) said they've 'done nothing wrong' Michelle Mone opens the new Ultimo concession at Debenhams, Glasgow in 2015 Doug Barrowman (left) pictured with Baroness Michelle Mone (right) at Cheltenham in 2019 The pair denied, via lawyers, involvement with PPE Medpro for three years. The pair pictured at Casa Do Lago restaurant in Quinta do Lago, in February this year While the rest of the UK was under strict lockdown, the couple married and were able to share their celebrations with 90 guests, thanks to the Isle of Man's decision to scrap social distancing, before jetting off on honeymoon to the Maldives. But, behind these jubilant scenes, trouble was already brewing for the mega-rich lovebirds. Just a month after their lavish nuptials, journalists began asking questions about Lady Mone's links to PPE Medpro. She consistently denied any 'role or function' in the company, with her lawyers insisting she was 'not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity'. But it later emerged that the former model contacted then Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and fellow Tory peer Theodore Agnew in May 2020, offering to supply PPE equipment 'via my team in Hong Kong' — five days before PPE Medpro was even incorporated as a company by her husband's business associates. The firm was then fast-tracked by the Government through its 'VIP lane' for politically connected companies. READ MORE - Tory peer Michelle Mone and her husband admit for the first time their involvement with firm at centre of fraud probe after being awarded £200m in PPE contracts during the pandemic Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> She and her husband broke their silence today in the documentary where they spoke to Mark Williams-Thomas, an investigative journalist who is best known for exposing Jimmy Saville as a paedophile in The Other Side of Jimmy Saville, a television documentary he presented in 2012. Lady Mone had initially denied having any links to PPE Medpro but admitted in the film: 'I made an error in what I said to the press. 'I regret not saying to the press straight away, 'Yes, I am involved.' And the Government knew I was involved.' The film, part of a public fightback, was funded by PPE Medpro, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Lady Mone, who was made a peer by Lord David Cameron in 2015, claimed it is '100% a lie' to suggest she was not transparent with officials, and her husband claimed a 'DHSC negotiator' suggested the case could 'go away' for the right sum. She said in the documentary: 'It's 100 per cent a lie. It's not true. I wanted the guys to succeed, I wanted the NHS to succeed. I wanted a win-win situation.' When asked what she felt when the pandemic hit, she said: 'I thought I could fix it. I could fix it by getting quality PPE on time at the best prices.' The Baroness said she is now breaking her silence on the controversy as she 'just can't take it anymore'. She claimed she has received messages from people calling for her to be put in jail, for her to be 'put in an orange jumpsuit' and even someone who wrote 'I'm going to throw acid on her'. The scandal has negatively affected her mental health, as she admitted she is seeing a doctor and is on medicine currently. The pair met with investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas for the documentary She was made a Conservative life peer in 2015 (pictured in 2019 at the House of Lords) Baroness Mone and Douglas Barrowman at 'Dining With The Stars' charity dinner in 2019 She said: 'I'm not doing well at the moment with my mental health. I don't want people to feel sorry for me but I'm in a lot of pain and I'm struggling. 'It's been a real fight. But we will win because we've done nothing wrong. It's cruel and it's nasty but we will win.' Lady Mone argued she is being used as a scapegoat by the Government for its own Covid failings. 'I am ashamed of being a Conservative peer given what this Government has done to us,' she told The Telegraph. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, who allegedly had involvement in the contract process, insisted that 'ministers did not take individual decisions' on pandemic contracts. Mr Gove told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: 'Those decisions were taken after a painstaking process by teams of civil servants who assess the worthiness of any contract that's put forward. 'So the suggestion, which some have put forward, that somehow ministers were seeking deliberately to do favours, or line the pockets of other individuals, I think is totally unjustified because the decisions were only taken after a proper, coherent and fair procurement process. 'As with any procurement process, might it sometimes be the case that the goods which have been bought turn out to not to be adequate - that is deeply regrettable but that is a consequence of what happened at pressure.' Matt Hancock and Mr Gove were both questioned by NCA as part of their investigation. Others questioned include Lord Bethell, a former Health Minister, and Lord Agnew, who served in the Cabinet Office. Former Health Secretary Hancock has previously claimed the Baroness sent him 'aggressive' emails. In response, she said in the film: 'I can sometimes come across as feisty, but I'm not aggressive, I'm not abusive. To be honest, I'm not a fan of his anyway.' Mr Hancock was responsible for four companies being referred to the VIP contracts scheme. One of them was Excalibur Healthcare Services, a medical company run by a Labour donor that was asked to provide ventilators. The firm charged £135 million, or £50,000 each, to supply 2,700 ventilators. Three weeks earlier another company had provided the same model of VG70 ventilator for £8,800, according to the Times. A DHSC spokesman said: 'We do not comment on ongoing legal cases.'

"Adverts for three airlines have been banned by a regulator for giving consumers a misleading impression of their environmental credentials. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the Google ads seen in July for Air France, Lufthansa and Etihad must not be published again. The ad for Air France, the watchdog explained, had stated that it was ""committed to protecting the environment"" and had urged consumers to ""travel better and sustainably"" amid the fight against climate change. Lufthansa had suggested that its customers would ""Fly more sustainably"" while Etihad's ad claimed its service included ""Environmental Advocacy"". The ASA said Air France had not fully engaged with its inquiry. Lufthansa agreed to remove the phrase ""fly more sustainably"" from future advertising but told the ASA it was a reference to its ""Green Fares"" option, which passengers could select on European flights and reduced 20% of flight-related CO2 emissions by using sustainable aviation fuel. Etihad said it had immediately removed all references to ""Environmental advocacy"" from its paid-for Google search ads in the UK upon receiving the ASA's ruling. The regulator said air travel produces high levels of both carbon dioxide and non-CO2 emissions, which are making a substantial contribution to climate change. Its statement said: ""In the absence of any evidence demonstrating that Air France were protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable, we concluded that the claims gave consumers a misleading impression of the impact that travelling with Air France would have on the environment."" Advertisement Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:42 Inside flight fuelled by cooking oil It ruled that the basis of Lufthansa's Green Fares option should have been made clear in its ad and that Etihad had not demonstrated evidence of environmental advocacy. An Etihad spokesman said: ""Sustainability is a key priority for Etihad, which runs a comprehensive programme to address aviation decarbonisation, working to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment by investing billions into its fleet of modern, fuel-efficient aircraft, research into sustainable aviation fuels, as well as carbon offsetting and reforestation through the Etihad Mangroves. ""The airline will continue to take bold and innovative steps including partnering with aircraft and engine manufacturers, sustainable fuel suppliers, academia and innovators to make flying more sustainable than it would be without such steps.""

Lufthansa regrets that the Google advertisement in question lacked the explanation of the further basis for the statement 'fly more sustainable'.

"Marketing experts say that companies who pulled ads from X over hate speech fears are unlikely to return to the beleaguered social media platform Marketing agencies say that the brands who fled X en masse following an apparent rise in hate speech on the platform are not coming back with one executive going so far as to say he's advising clients to cease even posting on the site. Since his takeover of the social media giant in 2022, Elon Musk has railed against the advertisers who paid to appear on the site, once threatening to go 'thermonuclear' against those who paused spending because of pressure from activist groups. Then this week, Musk told advertisers who left X: 'Go f**k yourself' during an appearance at The New York Times DealBook summit. That came after Musk apologized for endorsing an anti-Semitic post. Now, the founder of marketing consultancy firm AJL Advisory, Lou Paskalis, said there is no coming back for companies such as IBM. 'There is no advertising value that would offset the reputational risk of going back on the platform,' he told The Times. According to the Times reports, at least six major marketing agencies say that its clients are 'standing firm against advertising on X.' In the wake of Musk's outburst, CEO Linda Yaccarino went into damage control mode posting: 'X is enabling an information independence that is uncomfortable for some people.' 'X is standing at a unique and amazing intersection of Free Speech and Main Street — and the X community is powerful and here to welcome you,' she added. Chief strategy officer for Ebiquity Ruben Schreurs told the Times that Yaccarino comments don't 'resonate.' Schreurs added that the pausing of advertising on X was starting to look more and more like a 'termination.' Going a step further, one executive, Tom Hespos, of consultancy business Abydos Media, said that not only was he advising clients not to advertise on X but also to cease even posting on the platform. 'You can't with a good conscience make a recommendation to a client that they continue to be a part of [X],' he said. While another, Steve Boehler of Mercer Island Group, said that advertisers could take Musk's incendiary remarks personally. 'This is also personal. Businesses are simply full of people, and people like to be treated well, respected and dealt with with dignity,' he said. Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said: 'If anyone is killing X, it's Elon Musk - not advertisers.' Elon Musk on Wednesday appeared at the DealBook Summit in New York City Bob Iger, 72, the CEO of Disney, earlier said he would not advertise on X, due to Musk's anti-Semitic tweet. Musk replied: 'Go f*** yourself, is that clear? Hey Bob, if you're in the audience. That's how I feel, don't advertise' The South African-born billionaire is seen on Wednesday in conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin 'Should X collapse, an autopsy would reveal a series of platform policy decisions, staffing cuts, tweets and antagonistic comments by Musk that have driven away X's primary source of revenue,' Enberg said. An executive at a major global ad-buying firm, who declined to be named, said only one major client was continuing to advertise on X. '(Musk) seems to be hell bent on destroying the platform,' the executive said. Both Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery suspended advertising on X earlier this month. At Wednesday's event, Musk singled out Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger, who spoke earlier at the event and said an association with X was 'was not a positive one for us.' In a memo to employees on Thursday, X Chief Executive Linda Yaccarino said Musk's interview was 'candid and profound,' and encouraged staff to watch it. She reiterated that X's mission is to be an open platform without censorship. 'Our principles do not have a price tag, nor will they be compromised - ever,' the memo said. The Tesla chief also acknowledged that an extended boycott by advertisers could bankrupt X, formerly Twitter, but suggested that the public would blame the brands and not him for a potential collapse. Musk on November 19 attempted to clarify his November 15 tweet X risks not only losing corporate advertisers, but also money from political candidates, a revenue stream that reopened after the platform lifted a ban on political ads. US political ad spending in 2024 - when a presidential election will be held - is expected to reach a record $10.2 billion, according to AdImpact, which tracks political ads. Mike Nellis, CEO of Authentic, a digital marketing agency that works with Democratic candidates including U.S. President Joe Biden, said he planned to speak with all his clients about whether or not to spend on X. 'Telling major advertisers and Bob Iger to go F themselves might be the final nail in the coffin,' Nellis said. X has come under fire for lax content moderation, especially from advertisers who do not want their ads appearing next to inappropriate content. Ad spending on X in the United States from January through October this year declined 64 percent, compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from media analytics firm Guideline, which tracks advertising spending data from major ad agencies. 'We believe there is a risk that more companies will stop advertising on X; at least on a short-term basis,' D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Tom Forte said. 'It is fair to say this makes the company's subscription efforts more important and potentially means it may need more than half its revenue to come from subscriptions,' he said. U.S. monthly active users also declined by about 19 percent since Musk acquired Twitter last year, according to research firm Data.ai. Apple, IBM, Sony, Disney, Comcast and Paramount collectively accounted for 7 percent of total U. ad spend on X through October this year, Sensor Tower data showed. At the dinner hosted by the New York Times following the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, guests that included representatives of major brands were 'aghast' at witnessing Musk's expletives against advertisers, said one attendee who declined to be named. One sentiment seemed to be shared among brand representatives in discussing X: 'It's obvious (Musk) doesn't want us there and we don't want to be there,' the attendee said.

"Several major banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, have chosen to exit the process of seeking Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validation of their climate targets, ESG Today has confirmed, ahead of the anticipated launch by the organization of a new standard to assess financial institutions’ net zero goals, with criteria including strict limitations on fossil fuel financing. Additional banks exiting the SBTi validation process include Societe Generale and ABN AMRO, according to media reports. Founded in 2015, SBTi was formed as a collaboration between CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. In 2022, SBTi launched a process to establish standards for setting and assessing financial institutions’ net zero goals, and in June 2023, the organization published an exposure draft of the new standard, which contain a series of fossil fuel financing restrictions, including ending new financial flows to any part of the coal value chain, or to new unabated oil projects, as well as to coal companies or to companies planning new unabated capacity additions across the oil value chain. While a report from Reuters said that the banks’ decisions were based on “concerns it could hinder their ability to continue financing fossil fuels,” in statements provided by the companies, some banks indicated that the SBTi requirements would interfere with their ability to engage and service companies through their climate transitions, particularly those clients in less developed markets that are currently dependent on fossil fuel for their energy needs. In a statement provided by Standard Chartered, for example, the bank said that its net zero approach “seeks to support a just transition that encourages the economic and social development of our dynamic market footprint.” The bank added: “This is particularly important as the majority of our 52 markets do not have national net zero commitments, or have targets that run beyond 2050. As such, our activity focuses on ambition and engagement that accelerates the transition in the sectors and markets where change is needed most, and where the impact of climate change is often most acute. “The latest proposal for Financial Institutions from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) lacks sector guidance that adequately considers the transition of our clients and markets. As such, we have chosen not to seek SBTi validation for our targets and have instead pursued alternative third-party assurance.” Notably, each of the banks are signatories to the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a UN-convened coalition of banks dedicated to advancing global net zero goals through their financing activities. Members of the NZBA commit to transitioning operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their lending and investment portfolios to align with net zero pathways by 2050, and to set 2030 financed emissions targets, initially focused on key emissions intensive sectors. Societe Generale, for example, announced a target earlier this week to reduce exposure to the upstream oil and gas sector by 80% by 2030, and HSBC announced last year that it would no longer provide financing for new oil and gas projects or for new metallurgical coal mines. In a statement provided by HSBC, the bank said that it is “working to set financed emissions targets across our portfolio in line with NZBA guidance.” In a statement provided by the SBTi, the organization said that it received hundreds of responses to its June 2023 exposure standard, leading it to release a pilot version of near term criteria and recommendations for financial institutions and incorporating “draft Fossil Fuel Finance Position Paper criteria, which offers additional options for FIs to complement those already available to them.” The statement also said that the finalized criteria “will also remove some common barriers to the adoption of science-based targets by FIs.” The SBTi statement added:

"En español aquí On November 20, 2023, the Shuar Arutam People (PSHA) released a public statement rejecting the Warintza mining project and its possible sale. The statement reaffirms the environmental, legal, social, and reputational risks of the project for its potential buyers and investors of its parent company, Solaris Resources Inc., as reported in March in the Amazon Watch report, The Risks of Investing in Solaris Resources. PSHA’s statement comes in response to recent corporate disclosures from Solaris which outline efforts to further the exploration of the mine by seeking new financing and hiring a new chief operating officer to lead the project. This information also suggests that Chinese companies may be strong candidates for acquiring the mine – a project that has not undergone a consultation process. On October 3, 2023, Solaris announced the appointment of China International Capital Corporation Limited (CICC) as the company’s “Chinese financial advisor.” According to the company, it appointed CICC to assist in “fielding and evaluating the merit” of proposals it has received from parties interested in its Warintza copper project in the Ecuadorian Amazon. According to the analysts quoted in the Financial Post, a sale to a Chinese company “could trigger a review by the federal government under the Investment Canada Act (ICA)” because of a “policy that made it more difficult for foreign businesses, either owned or influenced by ‘non-like-minded’ nations, to own or take a stake in Canada’s critical minerals sector.” Indigenous communities affected by the Warintza project warn potential investors, stating that its operators lack a social license to operate. “We oppose any entity providing additional investment for this project in our territory or any attempt to sell the project to another company using and promoting the name of the Shuar people,” reads the November 20 statement. The PSHA also recounts its historical resistance to Canadian mining on its territory, noting that they evicted the last buyer of the project, Lowell Mineral Exploration from their territory in 2006. Solaris does not comply with international standards of Free, Prior, and Informed Consultation, as it seeks to impose the Warintza project by promoting division among communities. Jaime Palomino, President of PSHA, elaborates: “The Shuar Arutam people have consistently rejected the Warintza project for many years. Despite this, the company insists on promoting the project by dividing the communities and trying to reach agreements with other Indigenous organizations. Both the company and the Ecuadorian government should respect our own government structure and our autonomy. Therefore, we are unaware of and reject any agreement that is or has been signed on our behalf.” “The Warintza project not only impacts one of the most biodiverse and unique areas of the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Cordillera del Cóndor, but also implies serious risks for its investors. Investors should be concerned about investing in a project with over 20 years of firm and continued opposition by Indigenous communities whose collective Indigenous Peoples’ right to self-determination has been denied” says Viviana Herrera, the Latin America Coordinator for MiningWatch Canada. Raphael Hoetmer, Western Amazon Program Director at Amazon Watch states: “Contrary to optimistic projections and assessments of future mineral exploitation by Warintza, the stark truth is that the project has an uncertain prognosis. The Warintza project was suspended between 2006 and 2019 due to Shuar opposition, and it is currently seeking to move forward in a climate of high conflict. Therefore, potential gaps in disclosures about this opposition may mislead current investors and future buyers of the viability, profitability, and financial risks of the project.” PSHA’s pronouncement contradicts Solaris, which has focused on signaling to the financial community that it is making progress in securing the social license needed to make the sale of the project attractive, by creating what the company calls a “Strategic Alliance” with only two of the 47 Shuar communities. This strategy of division undermines PSHA´s organizational structure as has been denounced by the Shuar Arutam People. Background For over two decades, the Shuar Arutam People (PSHA), Southwest Ecuador, in the Amazonian province of Morona Santiago, in the Cordillera del Cóndor, have firmly expressed their opposition to extractive megaprojects, including mining in their territory. In 2019, they declared their lands “a territory of life (TICCA)” and launched an international campaign “The Shuar Have Already Decided: No Mining!” In January 2021, PSHA’s Governing Council, together with Public Services International (PSI), filed a complaint with the ILO against the Ecuadorian government for violation of ILO Convention 169 and for violating their collective rights and not consulting them on projects being carried out on our territory. In 2019, Solaris Resources acquired Lowell Mineral Exploration and the controversial Warintza Project, which has remained dormant since 2006 after PSHA evicted Lowell Mineral Exploration.

"A kind-hearted schoolboy is opening a Christmas present bank to help those struggling to afford to buy gifts for their families. Isaac Winfield, 12, from Redditch, Warwickshire, captured the hearts of the nation by opening food banks during the pandemic, using his birthday money, and now he is looking to give assistance to the less fortunate over the festive period. The new bank will open on Wednesday, October 13 and have a range of wooden toys, family games and cosy winter clothing handed out by Isaac and his mother Claire Chapman, 43. And he's received £2,000 worth of donations from Aldi to help him get started. IIsaac Winfield, 12, from Redditch, Warwickshire, has set up a present bank for struggling families, with some help from Aldi Isaac Winfield re-stocking The shed at Greenlands, Redditch which is part of the Friends of Isaac's Food Bank, that was broken into during the early hours earlier this year Isaac, who has a rare chromosome disorder and lives with brothers Toby, 10, and Jacob, 22, has been hailed as 'Santa's little helper' by his community. He said: 'I'm so happy with the donations from Aldi - my shed is so well stocked with gifts for anyone who needs them, just in time for Christmas'. His mother Ms Chapman added: 'Christmas can be a stressful time and Isaac wanted to help as many people as possible have a celebration without worrying about what is under the tree. 'He is absolutely ecstatic about the donation and seeing his shelves full with toys and gifts for families he's dedicated his weekends and spare time to helping is the best Christmas present he could have asked for'. In October this year Isaac made headlines after one of the sheds he uses as a food bank was raided by burglars, stealing over £50 worth of food. Isaac, from Redditch, Worcestershire, was left with bare shelves as a result of the theft, until donations from across the country came in, including £500 worth of groceries from Aldi. Now, the budget supermarket has taken its support of Isaac one step further and donated £2,000 worth of gifts to his new present bank. Isaac Winfield, 11, who suffers from a rare chromosome disorder has asked his mum to donate to his food bank for his birthday present this year after he set it up back in December 2020 Isaac impressed execs at Aldi UK who gave him some generous funding so that he could help families this Christmas Julie Ashfield, Managing Director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: 'We're thrilled that we were able to help out Isaac and his local community again. 'His story really struck a chord with us - Isaac continues to do amazing, vital work and helping to ease the mind of families by ensuring there are presents under the tree is certainly an important Christmas gift'. Isaac started his food bank with £40 worth of Aldi groceries in November 2020.

"Airbnb is set to use artificial intelligence to crack down on unauthorized New Year's Eve parties and ban violators from the platform. That means hosts such as Mariah Carey - who famously served as a host for an Airbnb near Times Square in 2020 - and partygoers looking for a place to celebrate the holiday could be left partying at home. The AI technology will be used to restrict certain New Year's Eve bookings in seven countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Canada and France. Last year, 63,000 Americans were blocked from New Year's Eve rentals on suspicion of hosting a large party. 'When it comes to how we use technology like AI, we're focused on taking a thoughtful approach that aims to benefit Hosts, guests and neighborhoods,' said Naba Banerjee, the head of trust and safety at Airbnb. 'We're optimistic these measures will help have a positive impact for the communities we serve,' Banerjee added. Airbnb is set to use artificial intelligence to crack down on unauthorized New Year's Eve parties and ban violators from the platform. Pictured: A dome near Times Square that Mariah Carey served as Airbnb host for in 2020 The move represents another measure to prevent disruptive and unauthorized parties after the booking website saw thousands of people blocked from booking entire home listings last New Year's Eve The system will identify one, two, and three-night booking attempts for entire home listings over the holiday weekend to enforce the company's anti-party measures Airbnb's AI system will identify one, two, and three-night booking attempts for entire home listings over the holiday weekend to enforce the company's anti-party measures. The technology will analyze hundreds of factors, including how long the guest plans to stay, how far the listing is from their location, the type of property they're booking, and if the reservation is being made at the last minute. The platform is activating AI and machine-learning technology to analyze hundreds of signals and block bookings that are identified as 'potentially higher-risk for a party incident,' a company statement reads. Last year, approximately 13,200 guests were blocked from booking in the U.K. and 5,400 in Australia, according to the company's booking data. Aside from AI technologies, the company has deployed other measures to enforce its 'global party ban' on New Year's Eve, including a reservation screening, noise sensors for hosts, a neighborhood support line and a 24-hour safety line. The company did not seem too concerned about disruptive parties and the risk of spreading the virus when it set up a geodesic dome in New York's Times Square for New Year's Eve Mariah Carey, who has performed in Times Square in previous years on December 31, personally greeted lucky guests in the transparent dome The booking platform introduced its party ban in August 2020, as the pandemic drew party-goers from bars and restaurants to rented houses. However at the turn of 2020, the company did not seem too concerned about disruptive parties and the risk of spreading the virus when it set up a geodesic dome in New York's Times Square for New Year's Eve. The groovy geodesic dome, complete with a huge bed, on the lofty terrace of stock market index Nasdaq was set up for guests to enjoy the panoramic views of the New Year's Eve Ball and the confetti celebrations. Carey, who has performed in Times Square in previous years on December 31, personally greeted (virtually) lucky guests in the transparent dome. Airbnb said: 'With Times Square celebrations going virtual this year, guests will have a truly unique experience during the traditional confetti celebrations, right below the Ball. 'Life in New York City in 2020 was defined by the resiliency and sacrifices made by frontline workers - and people across the globe were inspired by the bravery and contributions of these everyday heroes. 'Nasdaq and Airbnb recognize that the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted how people plan for future activities and are closely monitoring guidance from local government and health officials,' the company said at the time. But as it saw more guest throwing unauthorized parties in properties they booked through Airbnb, the company decided to codify the party ban as its policy last year. 'We focus on trying to deter the very rare cases of Hosts who do not operate responsibly, or guests who try to throw unauthorized parties,' the company said. The booking platform introduced its party ban in August 2020, as the pandemic drew party-goers from bars and restaurants to rented houses Last year, more than 63,000 people were banned from reserving an entire home listing on New Year's Eve through Airbnb in the U.S. The company also stated that guests violating the rules could face serious consequences 'varying from account suspension to full removal from the platform.' As Airbnb embraces AI to further crack down on New Year's Eve parties, public reactions are divided. 'When you're spending that kind of money, for you to have rules and regulations seems kind of unfair, especially for them to start profiling people to decide who can come and who can't,' Ken Kyles told CBS8. 'What algorithm, what AI, what parameters are they using?,' asked Jordan Germinaro, who lives in San Diego, California. 'Who is going to get rejected from renting, and if it is just going to be for parties, or if they can use 'parties' as an excuse to discriminate against certain guests?' he asked. Rian Chandler-Dovis said she's split on this issue as she knew the policy could 'take away business from Airbnb hosts if the platform is blocking potential guests.' ""But I do understand and live in a residential neighborhood where sometimes people come in and have parties, and it's really no fun when you're raising kids and they have school the next day,"" she said.

"DETROIT – General Motors has cut the size of its Buick dealership network roughly in half in the U.S. through an ongoing voluntary buyout program, an executive told CNBC. The 1,000-store reduction aims to increase the amount of sales per location, or throughput, and profits at the remaining dealers, according to Duncan Aldred, global head of GM's Buick and GMC brands. The buyouts also allow dealers who don't want to invest in electric vehicles to get out of the business. ""What this is enabling us to do that is triple the throughput of the remaining dealers,"" Aldred said during an online interview. ""I think it's fair to say that I'm really pleased that we achieved it."" Buick plans to continue to offer buyouts, which have cost GM about $1 billion thus far, into next year. The average sales of the remaining stores still trail those of GM's GMC brand, which largely shares showrooms with Buick, according to Aldred. A majority of the dealers who took buyouts were smaller stores, which represented only about 20% of Buick's annual sales. As part of the buyouts, the company offers payments for the dealers to cease operating their businesses. The voluntary buyout program with Buick's roughly 2,000 U.S. franchise dealers started last year, as the brand began investments in its transition to exclusively offering all-electric vehicles domestically by 2030. Dealers need to invest in training, tools, and special equipment for the EV transition. Buick declined to disclose how much investment is needed, saying specific costs may vary depending on the size and scope of the dealership.

"WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - The United States and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reached a settlement on Thursday over the tech firm's apparent violations of sanctions and export controls, which it disclosed voluntarily, the government and the company said. Microsoft has agreed to remit about $3 million to settle its potential civil liability for more than 1,300 apparent sanctions violations in relation to restrictions on Cuba, Iran, Syria and Russia involving the export of services or software from the U.S. to sanctioned jurisdictions, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement. The Treasury Department added that Microsoft's conduct was ""non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed."" A majority of the violations, which took place between 2012 and 2019, involved blocked Russian entities or persons located in the Crimea region of Ukraine, and occurred as a result of Microsoft's failure to identify and prevent the use of its products by prohibited parties, the Treasury Department said. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 before launching a full scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. In an emailed statement to Reuters, Microsoft acknowledged failures in its sanctions compliance and said it had cooperated with the probe and was pleased with the settlement. ""Microsoft takes export control and sanctions compliance very seriously, which is why after learning of the screening failures and infractions of a few employees, we voluntarily disclosed them to the appropriate authorities,"" a company spokesperson said. The causes of sanctions violations included a lack of complete or accurate information on the identities of the end customers for Microsoft products, the Treasury Department said, adding that there were shortcomings in Microsoft's restricted-party screening.

"March 31 (Reuters) - China's cyberspace regulator will conduct a cybersecurity review of products sold in the country by U.S. memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), the regulator said on Friday. The move, which comes amid a spat over chip technology between Washington and Beijing, is aimed at protecting the security of the supply chain for critical information infrastructure, prevent hidden risks and safeguard national security, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said in a brief statement. It gave no other details, including which Micron products it was reviewing. In a statement to Reuters, Micron said it was aware of the announcement and was ""in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully."" It added that it stands by the security of its products and commitments to customers. The U.S. has imposed a series of export controls on chipmaking technology to China for fear it could be used to produce chips for applications such as artificial intelligence which could be used by China's military, and blacklisted a number of China's largest chip firms, including Micron rival Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd. Micron, one of the world's largest memory chip makers, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The company's shares fell 3% to $61.15 on Friday. ""Punitive actions against Micron could suggest a broader shift in Chinese policy with other U.S. vendors with large Chinese exposure now potentially at risk of similar actions,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said. On Friday, Japan announced it would align its technology trade controls with a U.S. push to curb China's ability to make advanced chips. The Netherlands, which makes advanced lithography equipment critical for the manufacture of advanced chips, made a similar announcement earlier this month. Weak consumer demand has roiled the memory chip market, which is dominated by South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). Micron derives around 10% of its revenue from China, but it was not clear if the review would affect the company's sales to non-Chinese customers in the country. The larger chunk of the company's products flowing into China are being purchased by non-Chinese firms for use in products manufactured in the country, according to analysts. Micron has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, the company announced it would shut its DRAM design operations in Shanghai.

"TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - (This March 15 story has been corrected to remove the reference to EU state aid bans in paragraph 3) Taiwan chipmaker TSMC's (2330.TW) talks with the German state of Saxony about building a new factory are at an advanced stage and are now focused on government subsidies to support the investment, two people familiar with the matter said. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and Asia's most valuable listed company, flagged in 2021 that it was in the early stages of reviewing a potential expansion into EU member Germany, in what would be its first European plant. The European Union last year unveiled the European Chips Act to ease government funding rules for semiconductor plants, as the bloc tries to guarantee supplies after a chip shortage and supply chain bottlenecks during the COVID-19 pandemic. One person briefed on the matter said talks between TSMC and Saxony are ""serious and advanced"", and delegations from the eastern German state with its capital in Dresden, have been coming to Taiwan for talks with TSMC. Given the higher costs associated with building in Germany, including for labour, TSMC has been discussing subsidies it could get in return for building the factory, said the person, who declined to be identified because the talks are private. TSMC said in December that there was ""no concrete plan"" to build a chip factory in Germany. In January, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the company was talking to customers and partners about building an automotive-focused plant in Europe based on customer demand and the level of government support. TSMC declined to comment further. The EU has been courting Taiwan as one of the ""like-minded"" partners it would like to work with to build new plants to shore up chip supplies. The German and Saxony governments are willing to give subsidies but they also need further EU funds, the second person familiar with the situation said. ""Without subsidies nobody will come,"" the person added. The Saxony government said decisions about building plants would be taken by companies, but added it was always in talks with leading firms about investing further in the region. Saxony officials discussed the EU Chips Act with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on March 6 in Brussels, according to the state government. Germany's economy ministry said it could not comment on individual company plans, but noted the federal government was willing to support and promote semiconductor production projects under the European Chips Act. The European Commission declined to comment. TSMC is already expanding internationally. It has committed $40 billion to build a chip factory in the U.S. state of Arizona, and is also building one in Japan and considering a second one there. The Arizona factory, among the largest foreign investments in U.S. history, will start production in 2024, using advanced 5-nanometre technology. Construction was announced after the U.S. passed a law granting $53 billion in subsidies and tax credits for the chips industry. TSMC's German factory, if is goes ahead, will likely produce less advanced chips, especially those used in the auto industry, the first person said. ""These are the kinds of chips German industry needs,"" the person added.

"watch now Washington asked TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its stake in the short video app or face a possible ban in the U.S., CNBC has confirmed. TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told Reuters that the company had recently heard from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The committee told ByteDance to sell its shares in TikTok, or the app could face a U.S. ban. Oberwetter or the U.S. Treasury Department were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. A person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, told CNBC that TikTok had been contacted by CFIUS but the firm was seeking further clarity from Washington. The Wall Street Journal first reported the U.S. move. The U.S. has a number of concerns about TikTok and has maintained the app presents a national security risk. Washington is concerned that American user data on TikTok could fall into the hands of the Chinese government, due to a law in China that compels firms to hand over information to Beijing if they are requested to do so. TikTok has repeatedly stated that U.S. user data is not stored in China where those laws apply. Washington is also concerned that TikTok could be used for influence operations by China. A TikTok spokesperson said divesting the business would not resolve the U.S.'s concerns. ""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" the spokesperson said. ""The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing."" It's not the first time that TikTok has faced an outright ban in the U.S. Former President Donald Trump in 2020 tried to ban the short video app and then pushed to get TikTok spun off from ByteDance. The U.S. courts ended up blocking Trump's attempts. Washington has reportedly told TikTok that its Chinese parent company ByteDance needs to divest the short video app or it could face a ban in the U.S. CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images

"Summary Summary Companies Record net profit compares to $110 billion in 2021 Board recommends issuing bonus shares to eligible shareholders Aramco declares $19.5 billion dividend for Q4        DUBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco (2222.SE) on Sunday reported a record annual net profit of $161.1 billion for 2022, up 46% from the previous year on higher energy prices, increased volumes sold and improved margins for refined products. The profits, which are around triple that of Exxon's $56 billion, follow similar reports in February from international peers such as BP (BP.L) , Shell (SHEL.L), and Chevron (CVX.N) which have mostly posted record profits for last year. Oil prices swung wildly in 2022, climbing on geopolitical worries amid the war in Ukraine, then sliding on weaker demand from top importer China and worries of a global economic contraction. ""Given that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real — including contributing to higher energy prices,"" Aramco's chief executive Amin Nasser said in the results statement. To address those challenges, the company is investing in new lower-carbon technologies with potential to achieve additional emission reductions, Nasser said. Plans to up crude production capacity to 13 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027 are on track, the statement said. Aramco's capital expenditure rose 18% to $37.6 billion in 2022 and the company said it expects this year's spending to be around $45.0 billion to $55.0 billion including external investments. Aramco declared a dividend of $19.5 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% from the previous quarter. Its board also recommended to issue bonus shares, with eligible shareholders receiving one share for every 10 shares owned. Free cash flow reached a record of $148.5 billion in 2022, compared to $107.5 billion in 2021. Prices surged in March last year as Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended global crude flows, with international benchmark Brent reaching $139.13 a barrel, highest since 2008. Prices cooled rapidly in the second half of 2022 as central banks hiked interest rates and fanned worries of recession. The OPEC+ producer alliance, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed last year to cut output by 2 million bpd from November until the end of 2023 to support the market. The decision drew heavy criticism from the United States and other Western countries but market dynamics since then have shown the cuts to be prudent with oil prices hovering near the $80 a barrel from highs of above $100 in 2022.

"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported. The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime' Alexander now faces having the role stripped from him after he reportedly signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel an 'apartheid regime' Aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City on October 11 The letter which was allegedly signed by Alexander, who is non-binary and uses he/him pronouns, said: 'We are watching a genocide take place in real time. 'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.'

"Kanye West was obsessed by Adolf Hitler long before the troubled rapper went public with anti-Semitic comments in 2022 yet Adidas executives ignored his disturbing behavior while giving him access to a $100 million-a-year slush fund, according to a jaw-dropping new report. West's relationship with Adidas, thought to be nearly as lucrative as Nike's decades-long partnership with Michael Jordan, is brought under the spotlight in a New York Times report where the sportswear giant is accused of turning a blind eye to West's fascination with Hitler and the Nazis. Among the allegations are that in 2018, West, 46, asked a Jewish company executive to kiss a picture of Adolf Hitler every day as a way to show unconditional love and drawing a swastika on a pair of sneakers during a visit to Adidas' headquarters in Germany. The article notes that around the time that West launched his doomed presidential campaign and his now-shuttered Christian school, Adidas agreed to pay him $100 million-a-year 'that he could spend with little oversight.' Other allegations also resurface in the report, including that West would force employees to watch pornography at the office. Almost a year ago, Adidas ended a major partnership with West over his statements, discontinued West's line of Yeezy shoes and moved up the planned departure of its CEO. Kanye West was obsessed by Adolf Hitler long before the troubled rapper went public with anti-Semitic comments in 2022 yet Adidas executives ignored his disturbing behavior Adidas (headquarters pictured) agreed to pay Kanye $100 million-a-year 'that he could spend with little oversight.' Kayne said that he wanted to go 'death con 3' on Jewish people. According to Forbes, he lost $1.5 billion of his estimated $2 billion fortune after Adidas cut ties with the singer - kicking him off the World's Billionaires list West's relationship with Adidas was thought to be nearly as lucrative as Nike's decades-long partnership with Michael Jordan In a statement at that time, the company said it 'does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech.' It added his 'recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.' Three years after West drew a swastika on the sneakers, Adidas extended its deal with the Life of Pablo rapper. The report alleges that executives even knew that West was planning to name an album after Hitler but later settled on the name Ye. West is accused of showering praise on Hitler calling him a 'master marketer' and lauded his control of the media. Jon Wexler, then Adidas’s global director of entertainment and influencer marketing, who a hugely important part of bringing West on board with the company, said that West told him hang a picture of Hitler in his kitchen and kiss it every morning. Wexler said that the rapper made that remark after the two had an argument related to West's views on slavery. The Times' report reiterates that allegations that West was 'angry' at the offices of his Yeezy brand and that he would regularly make sexually crude comments to 'staff. He's also accused of drinking while at the offices. During one exchange, West told Eric Liedtke, Adidas' global brand manager, that he was forced to pay off a former employee millions because of the rapper's constant Hitler references. In another section of the article, it's revealed that members of the team at Adidas that worked directly with West were given a free subscription to a meditation app, had group therapy sessions and had a member of the human resources team assigned to them. The piece gone on to say that executives started a Yzy Hotline text group to discuss the problems they had working with him. In one exchange, they discussed taking certain aspects of the business away from his control. Just this past September, Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said during an appearance on the In Good Company podcast that he doubted that West, 'meant what he said' when he made his anti-Semitic remarks. 'I think Kanye West is one of the most creative people in the world,' Gulden said in an episode released Sept. 12. 'Very unfortunate, because I don't think he meant what he said and I don't think he's a bad person. It just came off that way.' During one exchange, West told Eric Liedtke, Adidas' global brand manager, that he was forced to pay off a former employee millions because of the rapper's constant Hitler references West tweeted he would be 'going death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE' while bringing back his 'White Lives Matter' T-shirt For weeks prior to his rupture with the sneaker company, West had made anti-Semitic comments in interviews and social media, including an October Twitter post in which he said he would soon go 'death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,' an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale known as DEFCON. He had previously suggested that slavery was a choice and called the COVID-19 vaccine the 'mark of the beast,' among other comments. The New York Times report alleges that during meetings at Adidas when he became frustrated, he would accuse the company of treating him like a slave. He also took heat for wearing a 'White Lives Matter' T-shirt to Paris Fashion Week and putting models in the same design. In 2020, West's then-wife Kim Kardashian said that the rapper has bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings. West expressed some regrets in a podcast interview, but a few months later tweeted an image of a swastika merged with the Star of David, leading the platform to suspend him. After he received the same treatment on other social media outlets, West offered to buy Parler, a conservative social network with no gatekeeper. No deal ever materialized. The break with West left Adidas with a huge supply of unsold Yeezy sneakers that it has begun to sell in limited batches. It has held two such sales — one in May, the other last month. For both of those sales, Adidas said it donated a portion of the proceeds to charities such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change. West's net worth sustained a significant hit when Adidas ended their partnership in October West has faced a slew of controversy since he was pictured wearing a White Live Matter shirt at a Paris Fashion Week event last year The company has not said how many of those shoes remain in inventory, although the unsold shoes and West's departure impacted Adidas profits. Executives estimated that it held $1.3 billion worth of Yeezy inventory when it broke off its partnership. The company faces other problems tied to the rapper. Investors sued Adidas in the U.S., alleging the company knew about West's offensive remarks and harmful behavior years before the split and failed to take precautionary measures to limit financial losses. The lawsuit — representing people who bought Adidas securities between May 3, 2018, and February 21, 2023 — pointed to reports of West making anti-Semitic statements in front of Adidas staff in addition to his other remarks. Adidas said at the time that it rejected 'these unfounded claims and will take all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them.

"Walmart has become the latest big advertiser to pull its spending on X amid concerns about a rise in anti-Semitism and hate speech on the platform. In a statement, Walmart said: 'We aren't advertising on X as we've found some other platforms better reach our customers.' The company officially went public with its decision on Friday, with X - formerly Twitter - later confirming the retail giant had not advertised on the platform since October. The announcement came just days after Musk went on an expletive-ridden rant during an on-stage interview where he told advertisers to 'go f*** yourself'. Musk and his beleaguered company have been scrambling to deal with the fallout after the Tesla boss sparked outrage by promoting an anti-Semitic tweet last month. Walmart said in a statement it had 'found other platforms' to reach out to customers, and had moved away from X The South African-born billionaire is seen on Wednesday in conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin Musk, who has been criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and Israel's Foreign Ministry for his past remarks, was responding to a man who posted a screed on X criticizing a Foundation to Combat Anti-Semitism campaign video. In the video, a father is seen talking to his son about the online hatred the son has spewed, and calling him out for his rhetoric. The X user dismissed the video, writing: 'Jewish communties (sic) have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. 'I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest s*** now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. 'You want truth said to your face, there it is.' Musk replied: 'You have said the actual truth.' Musk has since apologized for endorsing an anti-Semitic post - but many companies concerned about a rise in hate speech are continuing to pull away from the site. In the days following Musk's ill-advised November 15 tweet, companies including Apple, IBM, Paramount and Disney announced they were no longer advertising on his platform. According to internal documents seen by the New York Times, the move could be a serious blow to the platform's bottom line and cost the company $75million in lost ad revenue by the end of the year if advertisers do not return. The documents list more than 200 ad units of companies including Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network. Airbnb has stopped more than $1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads worth more than $800,000. Netflix's halted ads were worth nearly $3 million, according to X's estimates, while Microsoft's subsidiaries stopped spending $4 million. Amazon's units for books and music, and one subsidiary of Google, have also stopped their advertising, according to the paper. In the last quarter of 2022 - the last year the company reported fourth-quarter earnings before Musk took over - the company recorded $1.57 billion in revenue, of which nearly 90 percent came from advertising. Yet when Musk appeared at The New York Times DealBook summit earlier this week and was pressed by host Andrew Ross Sorking about his tweet, the tech boss hit back. He was asked specifically about Disney CEO Bob Iger, who explained his company's decision to pull advertising from the platform on stage earlier on Wednesday. 'I hope they stop,' said Musk, baffling the host, who replied: 'You don't want them to advertise?' Musk said: 'Don't advertise'. Sorkin then asked: 'What do you mean?' Musk responded: 'If someone is going to try and blackmail me with advertising? Blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself. 'Go f*** yourself, is that clear? Hey Bob, if you're in the audience. That's how I feel, don't advertise.' Elon Musk on Wednesday appeared at the DealBook Summit in New York City and launched a bitter tirade on advertisers Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, seen here, and his company have no moved away from advertising on the site In June, Musk brought in veteran advertising executive Linda Yaccarino as CEO, pictured here in September On Wednesday, Musk conceded: 'I should in retrospect not have replied to that particular post.' He added that the advertising boycott could 'kill the company', saying: 'What this advertising boycott is going to do is, it is going to kill the company. 'And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company.' The CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino - who was appointed by Musk in June after years working in advertising - sat in the front row, and was listening 'stone faced', The Hollywood Reporter said. Asked about his post, Musk said he had 'no problem being hated' adding: 'Essentially I handed a loaded gun to the people who hate me.' Musk complained that the media ignored his attempts to clarify his post - but insisted his visit to Israel this week, touring areas devastated in the October 7 attack, and meeting the country's leaders - was not 'an apology tour'. He also previously said that reports of him being anti-Semitic were untrue, and that stories to the contrary were 'bogus'. Bob Iger, 72, the CEO of Disney, earlier said he would not advertise on X, due to Musk's anti-Semitic tweet Musk on November 19 attempted to clarify his November 15 tweet, both seen her Musk bought the company in October 2022 for $44 billion and cut around 80 percent of staff, ending many of the content moderation policies that advertisers appreciated. In June, he brought in veteran advertising executive Linda Yaccarino as CEO, in a bid to quell fears. Musk has a long history of toying with dog-whistle rhetoric about Jewish people, in particular George Soros, who enraged him in May by selling his Tesla stock. He has also angered people with his response to the Israel-Hamas war. In the days after the October 7 Hamas terror attack, Musk was forced to delete a tweet which recommended an anti-Semitic account and a promoter of debunked videos as reliable sources of information about the attack on Israel

"BBC employees were reportedly instructed not to attend an upcoming march against antisemitism in London this weekend. According to U.K. outlet The Times, the upcoming National Solidarity March Against Antisemitism was deemed too ""controversial"" for the network’s employees — even its Jewish ones — to attend. BBC employees, including reporters and senior management, alleged that the network would not let them attend the upcoming rally. The march ""is set to be the largest demonstration in support of British Jews since the 1936 Battle of Cable Street,"" according to Campaign Against Antisemitism, the group organizing the event. PIERS MORGAN: JEWS HIDING FAITH, FEARING ATTACKS IN BERLIN IS ‘DISGUSTING’ AND ‘DEFIES COMPREHENSION’ The outlet reported that BBC employees looking to attend pro-Palestinian rallies had been barred from attending those as well. According to staff members, the decision to prohibit their attendance at the rally is in line with BBC guidelines regarding any ""controversial march or demonstration."" As the BBC reported in 2020, the network established guidelines mandating that staff members should not ""express a personal opinion on matters of public policy, politics, or controversial subjects,"" which covered attendance at rallies. However, in response to employees at the time seeking attendance at various pro-LGBTQ rallies, BBC Director General Tim Davie clarified that ""there is no issue for these staff attending community events that are clearly celebratory or commemorative and do not compromise perceptions of their impartiality."" Several employees disagreed with the BBC standard applied to the march against antisemitism as compared to the standard applied to LGBTQ or antiracist marches in the past. One told the Times, ""Racism is racism and something we should all abhor — but not when it comes to anti-Jewish racism it seems. If the BBC believes that racism is racism and not acceptable in any shape or form then going on a rally against antisemitism shouldn’t be an issue."" Film production company Fulwell 73 co-founder Leo Pearlman blasted the network over the decision. He told The Times: ""Just when one thinks the BBC cannot find a new depth of incompetence to sink to in their reporting and handling of these tragic last six weeks, they seem to have decided to draw a clear distinction between antisemitism and every other ‘ism’ with this directive to their staff."" THEY'RE ‘CELEBRATING’ A ‘MASSACRE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS’: JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENTS DENOUNCE ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST The Times quoted an anonymous BBC producer, who disagreed that allowing staff to go to the march compromised the network’s guidelines. The producer said: ""Antisemitism is not the same as overtly political support for Palestinians. You can object to Israeli political positions and reactions but fundamentally resurrecting antisemitic tropes and Jew hatred is a completely different matter."" Another BBC staffer commented, ""You would have thought that antisemitism was pretty straightforward. The world has turned on its head."" A BBC spokesperson provided a statement to The Times: ""The BBC is clear that antisemitism is abhorrent. We have established guidance around marches, which explains that different considerations apply depending on what you do for the BBC. Corporately, we have not issued any staff communication on any specific march this weekend, but this does not mean discussions which consider the guidance have not taken place between colleagues."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Campaign Against Antisemitism ripped the BBC as well, stating: ""Clearly, if these reports are accurate then it is an outrageous restriction for the BBC to place on its employees. Part of the problem that British Jews are facing is that antisemitism has somehow become a matter of debate with two sides. The BBC must urgently clarify which side it is on."" The BBC did not immediately reply to FOX News Digital’s request for comment.

"Russia have been invited to compete in the Central Asian Football Association (Cafa) Championship in June, amid speculation over a switch to the Asian confederation (AFC) as the country seeks a return to international competition. Russian teams have been suspended from European and Fifa competitions since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The Tajikistan Football Federation (TFF) said Russia had been invited to Cafa’s inaugural men’s tournament scheduled for 9-21 June along with Cafa’s six member nations and another country yet to be confirmed. Cafa is part of the AFC and was formed in 2014. It comprises the national federations of Afghanistan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The TFF said Russia had accepted the invitation, but the Russian football federation (RFU) told the news agency Tass the possibility and conditions of the team’s participation were being discussed. Regional competitions, such as the Copa América, often invite guest countries from outside the federation to tournaments. The Russian Under-17 women’s team will participate in the South Asian Football Federation Championship from 20-28 March. Switching from the Uefa to Asia’s 47-nation confederation had been touted by the RFU president, Alexander Dyukov, as a possible option to allow the Russian national teams and clubs continued international competition. The men’s team played three friendlies last year, against Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. They are scheduled to face Iran and Iraq this month. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

"Recommendation of draft Task Force report undermines local control In response to the Baltimore Water Regional Governance Task Force draft report that recommends a regional authority, 21 community, labor, environmental and social justice organizations are demanding that the Task Force reject that approach, calling for city and state elected officials to protect local control of the city’s largest asset – the $5.5 billion water and sewer system. The public comment period on the draft report extends until only January 5, 2024, affording the public very little time to review and provide feedback over the Holiday season. According to the draft report, control of the water and sewer system would transfer to a new authority board whose members would be appointed by Baltimore City, Baltimore County and the Governor. At the last task force meeting, task force members expressed concern with this approach because of major unsolved challenges associated with an authority, including refinancing existing debt at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, transferring the workforce and worker pensions, and overturning Baltimore City’s charter provision that bans water privatization. “At a time when our city is working hard for local control of our schools and police, it is alarming and outrageous that we face the prospect of losing local control of our essential water services,” said Mary Grant, the Public Water for All Campaign Director at Food & Water Watch. “The draft recommendation punts every single substantial issue — from worker pensions to water affordability to debt refinancing – to a transition period to a regional authority, but that information is critical to determine the viability of an authority in the first place. The task force must reject this preposterous and baseless recommendation, and instead move forward with improving the intermunicipal agreements to ensure safe, affordable, publicly controlled water for all.“ As laid out in the letter to the Task Force, advocates estimate that creating a regional water authority could result in an estimated $1.7 to 2.5 billion in transaction costs. This estimate includes the cost to refinance existing debt, cover lease payments, and ensure pension benefits under a new authority. The Task Force has not conducted a racial and economic equity assessment of a regional water authority, arguing that it is another issue to be addressed during the transition to an authority. Water affordability too was identified as an unresolved threshold issue to be addressed during the transition period. “The Task Force should conduct a racial equity impact assessment and an economic equity impact assessment on a regional authority model before recommending the model for future legislation,” said David Wheaton, economic justice policy fellow for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF). “Efforts to regionalize water systems in other jurisdictions such as Detroit have hurt Black communities. Baltimore is already working to address a water affordability crisis which has had a disproportionate and detrimental impact on the City’s Black neighborhoods. Hastily rushing to establish a new governance model without doing critical analyses on how a new model will affect Black residents and low-income ratepayers risks undermining this progress and creating even greater disparities.” The recommendation for a regional authority is predicated on baseless assumptions and vague arguments about greater economies of scale under that model, but the consultants have provided no data or evidence to substantiate any of their claims. In fact, experience from other cities that have undergone such a transition directly counter their assumptions. For example, the consultants claim without evidence that a regional authority will improve worker retention, but information from Detroit shows that the water system lost nearly 15 percent of its workforce through the transition to the Great Lakes Water Authority. The consultants also claim that an authority would lead to great water affordability, despite the potential multibillion-dollar cost of establishing the authority and despite academic studies finding authorities charge higher rates than municipal water departments. As case studies from Detroit and Tampa Bay show, a regional authority could lead to mass water shutoffs, water privatization and the loss of potentially thousands of unionized positions within city and county government.

"Court documents show Cruise could be fined about $1.5 million for allegedly covering up that accident General Motors' troubled robotaxi unit Cruise laid off nearly a quarter of its workforce following a string of safety incidents and recall of some of its cars. The company announced they would be letting go of 900 out of its 3,800 person workforce - 24 percent - to cut costs after its slew of safety problems. Court documents revealed the autonomous vehicle unit could be fined about $1.5 million for allegedly covering up the severity of an accident when a woman was stuck under one of their cars. Mo ElShenawy, president and CTO of Cruise, said: 'We are making staff reductions that will affect 24 percent of full-time Cruisers, through no fault of their own.' 'We are reducing our employee counts in operations and other areas. These impacts are largely outside of engineering, although some Tech positions are impacted also.' General Motors' troubled robotaxi unit Cruise let go of 900 out of its 3,800 person workforce - 24 percent Mo ElShenawy, President and CTO of Cruise said the company is restructuring to focus on delivering improvements to tech and vehicle performance On October 2, in San Francisco a woman was hit by an unrelated car that knocked her into the path of a driverless Cruise car, which braked hard before colliding with her. The robotaxi stopped on top of the woman for 30 minutes while she screamed for help. 'As we’ve shared, our goal is to focus our work on a fully driverless L4 service that meets a new AV [autonomous vehicle] performance bar, prioritize the Bolt platform, relaunch ridehail in one city to start, and enhance our safety standards and processes before we scale,' said ElShenawy. 'As a result of our decision to slow down commercialization, we are restructuring to focus on delivering the improvements to our tech and vehicle performance that will build trust in our AVs.' Last October, the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Cruise to remove its driverless cars from state roads, calling them a risk to the public and saying the company had misrepresented the safety of its technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in October opened an investigation into pedestrian risks at Cruise, and the Cruise board hired law firm Quinn Emanuel to review Cruise management's responses to regulators investigating the Oct. 2 accident. Footage taken by the Cruise vehicle and viewed by NBC revealed how the car hit the woman and threw her into the path of the taxi, which then ran her over. The sedan driver then fled the scene. In the October 2 incident, a passenger was trapped beneath a Cruise taxi for 30 minutes after another car pushed her into its path The vehicle initially stopped but still hit the person, before it then pulled to the right to get out of traffic, dragging the woman about 20 feet. She was pinned under one of the Cruise vehicle's tires and was critically injured. Footage posted to social media shows the victim's feet sticking out from under the white vehicle while a first responder checks on her. Police officers attempted to communicate with the trapped woman, with one officer kneeling on the pavement and shining a light under the car. The new footage from the vehicle showed that the car continued driving after the initial stop and attempted a 'pullover maneuver,' traveling about 20 feet while the pedestrian was still trapped underneath. In September, two Cruise driverless taxis blocked an ambulance carrying a critically injured car crash victim, who later died in hospital. CEO Kyle Vogt resigned following the incidents and took responsibilities for Cruise's failings, which includes running up loses of around $2 billion, in his resignation. The San Francisco-based company has been testing its fleet in the city since 2020 and began offering driverless taxi rides last year. The company has since expanded service to Austin, Phoenix and Houston. General Motors said they lost $1.1 billion as a result of the United Auto Workers strike and will cut spending to Cruise to save money. When General Motors bought the company it had been expecting annual revenue of $1 billion from Cruise by 2025 - a big jump from the $106 million last year. During the first nine months of this year Cruise posted pretax losses of $1.9 billion.

"Disgraced ex-BP boss Bernard Looney said he is ‘proud’ of his leadership of the oil company despite the board finding him guilty of serious misconduct. In his first statement since his shock exit in September, he said he was ‘disappointed with the way the situation has been handled’. BP’s board on Wednesday stripped the Irish businessman of £32million in pay and bonuses after an investigation found he had lied about previous relationships with colleagues. Looney said: ‘I am proud of what I achieved with my colleagues during my time as chief executive officer of BP. I am disappointed with the way this situation has been handled. ‘And, as I look to the future, I want to simply wish everyone at BP all the very best. They deserve nothing less.’ Ousted: BP this week stripped former chief exec Bernard Looney (pictured) of £32m in pay and bonuses after he lied about relationships with colleagues BP finance chief Murray Auchincloss was made the company’s interim boss in September but the board is yet to appoint a permanent replacement. Investors will be looking for BP to draw a line under a series of scandals when they make the chief executive appointment, analysts have said. Of the four most recent chief executives, three have been forced to resign, which has prompted concerns over BP’s workplace culture. AJ Bell head of financial analysis Danni Hewson said: ‘The problem for BP is that three of its last four bosses have shuffled off in this manner.’ She added: ‘There will be some who think it’s time for BP to bring in new blood, untainted by the past, and with an understanding of how other workplace cultures operate. ‘Corporate culture has become increasingly important – particularly when it comes to bringing in new talent with many competitors vying for their skillsets.’ Former chief executive Lord Browne resigned in 2007 after lying to a court to hide details about his private life. His successor Tony Hayward was then forced to quit after just three years in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Laura Lambie, the senior investment director at Investec, said the Looney saga had been ‘reputationally quite damaging’. ‘Whoever fills Bernard Looney’s shoes, one hopes we are not going to see this again,’ she told the BBC. ‘It does call into question the culture at BP, and whoever is taking charge needs to draw a line under that and move forward.’ On Wednesday evening BP’s board, led by the oil industry veteran Helge Lund, said that Looney had ‘knowingly misled’ directors over his previous relationships with staff. His actions amounted to ‘serious misconduct’, the board said, as it terminated Looney’s 12-month notice period.

"Drivers of diesel cars in a London borough have to fork out as much as 15 times more to park than those with electric vehicles. The Royal Borough of Greenwich charges residents with zero-emissions cars just £20 a year for a parking permit, but owners of the most polluting vehicles will have to fork out a massive £300. Annual business parking permits are also 15 times more expensive for diesel vehicles with the highest emissions, being £55 for non-polluting cars and £825 for those emitting more than 255 grams of CO2 per kilometre. The scheme, which builds on Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's Ulez scheme, is part of the council's plans 'to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality in the borough'. And hourly rates across the borough's car parks vary wildly depending on emissions too, from as little as 70p per hour for a zero-emission car in a Band A car park, to as much as £7 for the most polluting vehicles in a Band C car park. Greenwich council annual parking permit prices by emissions levels The Royal Borough of Greenwich charges residents with zero-emissions cars just £20 a year for a parking permit, but owners of the most polluting vehicles will have to fork out a massive £300 (stock photo) An hour of parking at a Band A car park is just 70p for an electric car, but £2 for a car with an emissions rate of more than 255 gCO2/km. For Band B and C car parks these charges are £1.75 against £5 and £2.45 against £7 an hour, respectively. An MP on the House of Commons transport committee branded the scheme, introduced in July this year, 'bonkers', saying it punishes locals and businesses in the area. Greg Smith told The Telegraph local authorities need to 'understand the real world' of how and where people get to work, go shopping and take their children to school. He added policies designed to punish those driving what a 'bureaucrat deems the ""wrong sort"" of car' negatively impacts residents and businesses that need affordable and access to parking. Tory leader of opposition at Greenwich council, Matt Hartley, told The Telegraph he was 'deeply concerned' about the impact the rise in parking costs will have on high streets and household finances already battered by the cost of living crisis. A dozen London boroughs, including Hackney, Kensington & Chelsea and Lambeth have introduced similar schemes, basing parking charges on emissions levels. Brighton and Hove City Council has also this month announced charges based on vehicle emissions. Hourly rates across the borough's car parks vary wildly depending on emissions too, from as little as 70p per hour for a zero-emission car in a Band A car park, to as much as £7 for the most polluting vehicles in a Band C car park (stock photo) These schemes come after it was revealed Sadiq Khan's controversial ULEZ expansion generated £5.3million in its first week with 300,000 extra drivers charged for driving non-compliant vehicles within Greater London. More than 425,000 ULEZ charges were paid in the week following the extension, compared to just 140,000 the week before. The scheme, branded a 'war on motorists', is designed to limit harmful pollution and means that anyone with a non-compliant vehicle has to pay a daily £12.50 fee to drive within London - or a larger fine if this is not paid. MailOnline has contacted The Royal Borough of Greenwich for comment.

"Airbnb is to hand over almost £500million to Italian authorities to end a protracted tax dispute. Prosecutors said Airbnb had failed to comply with a 2017 law obliging short-term rental platforms to collect 21 per cent of rental income on behalf of tax authorities. As a result Airbnb will pay £495million, after the US company was last month accused of owing as much as £672million in short-term rental taxes. Authorities had threatened to seize the funds from the company. Airbnb will not attempt to recover any money from its hosts and is working on new ways for hosts to have their taxes paid to the authorities directly. Airbnb said: ‘The vast majority of hosts on Airbnb in Italy are ordinary families that are using the platform for supplemental income. Prosecutors said Airbnb had failed to comply with a 2017 law obliging short-term rental platforms to collect 21% of landlords’ rental income for tax ‘We hope the agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency and recent legislative changes in Italy will provide these families with certainty about the rules around hosting.’ In the past, Italian prosecutors have recovered hundreds of millions of pounds from US tech behemoths including Google in 2017 and Apple. It comes amid widespread concerns over businesses like Airbnb, as permanent housing has become more unaffordable for local residents. Florence this year banned new Airbnb listings while tourist beds in Venice exceed the number of long-term residents. Airbnb is based in California, and was founded in 2008 as a marketplace for short and long-term holiday lets and charges a commission from each booking.

"A federal court jury decided late Monday that Google 's Android app store, Google Play, uses anti-competitive practices that hurt consumers and software developers. The verdict is a significant win for Epic Games and its CEO, Tim Sweeney, which have been fighting against mobile app stores and their fees since 2020 — including an unsuccessful challenge to Apple 's App Store rules which is currently being appealed to the Supreme Court. Sweeney attributed the win to revelations during the trial that Google had allegedly deleted or failed to keep records such as chats about its secretive deals with app makers. He also noted that it had been a jury trial, while the Apple case was decided by a judge. ""The brazenness of Google executives violating the law, and then deleting all of the records of violating the law,"" Sweeney said in an interview with CNBC. ""That was really astonishing. This is very much not a normal court case, you don't expect a trillion-dollar corporation to operate the way Google operated."" Epic Games originally sued Google in 2020, alleging it uses its dominant position as the developer of Android to strike deals with handset makers and collect excess fees from consumers. Google collects between 15% and 30% for all digital purchases made through its storefront. Epic tried to bypass those fees by charging users directly for purchases in the popular game Fortnite; Google then booted the game out of its store, spurring the lawsuit. The decision could give app makers a bigger revenue share of the digital app market, which is currently dominated by Google and Apple, and is worth about $200 billion per year. The loss for Google could also empower other antitrust-based challenges to the search giant's business, including a similar case brought by the Department of Justice. Monday's unanimous verdict came after a four-week trial in federal court in California. The jury found that Google acquired and maintained monopoly power in the Android app distribution market, as well as the in-app billing market for digital goods and services transactions. The result is markedly different than Epic Games' similar effort to change Apple's App Store, in which which it lost 9 of 10 counts in 2021. Its only win was a judgment to suspend a rule about being able to email app customers. That ruling is currently being appealed to the Supreme Court. One major difference was that Epic had a harder time finding documentation from inside Apple. Another is that Google's Android allows software to be installed from the internet, a process called sideloading, while Apple bars it. ""The big difference between Apple and Google is Apple didn't write anything down. And because they're a big vertically integrated monopoly, they don't do deals with developers and carriers to shut down competition, they just simply block at the technical level,"" Sweeney said. During the Google trial, Epic Games instead focused on whether Google locked up the app store market through deals with handset makers, and whether it scared users away from using Android's sideloading functionality through security warnings. It specifically called out secretive revenue-sharing contract deals with Samsung and Chinese handset makers, which these partners allegedly signed in exchange for supporting the Google Play Store on new devices. It also revealed that Google had entered into talks with Epic Games over an investment in the Fortnite maker.

"Visa and Mastercard are facing the prospect of a cap on so-called interchange fees charged on transactions made between the UK and continental Europe. The Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) said on Thursday it was proposing the return of a cap, which ceased to apply in the UK when Brexit was completed, after finding both companies had likely raised fees to an ""unduly high level"". The watchdog estimated they cost UK businesses an extra £150m-£200m last year alone. The payments regulator's review concentrated on charges set by Mastercard and Visa as the US pair account for 99% of debit and credit card payments in the UK. Both the EU and UK have ambitions to secure greater competition in the payments market but no homegrown European operator of scale has emerged. The PSR declared the market was not functioning in the way it would like. It planned to impose an initial time-limited cap of 0.2% on UK-European Economic Area (EEA) debit transactions and 0.3% on credit transactions. The final cap would be set once further analysis was carried out, it said of its plans. The regulator said of its probe: ""Every time people use Mastercard or Visa debit or credit cards issued in the EEA for online retail transactions with UK businesses, UK businesses pay cross-border interchange fees. Advertisement ""After Mastercard and Visa significantly raised some of these fees in 2021 and 2022, the PSR has been examining the level of these fees to understand whether they, or other factors, indicate the market is not working well."" Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Chris Hemsley, managing director at the PSR, said: ""In this market review we have provisionally found that the fees charged by Mastercard and Visa to UK businesses... are likely too high. ""In short, at this stage, we do not think this market is working well. ""Should we ultimately conclude this is the case, our interim report sets out a range of potential solutions which could be implemented. ""They are designed to make sure cross-border interchange fees are set at a level that better reflects the interests of all Mastercard and Visa users."" A spokesperson for Visa said the company strongly disputed the findings of the PSR's interim report and said the proposed remedies were ""not justified"". ""Accepting reliable, secure, and innovative digital payments represents enormous value to UK businesses, especially when selling overseas,"" the spokesperson said. ""These interchange rates apply to less than 2% of UK card payments - European (EEA) cardholders buying online from a UK seller - and reflect the fact that these transactions are more complex and carry far greater risk of fraud."" Mastercard responded: ""We do not agree with the PSR's findings and will continue to educate them on the critical importance of electronic payments to the UK economy. ""In an extremely competitive payments market, interchange reflects the value provided to consumers and businesses. ""We enable fast, safe and simple transactions, protect consumers from fraud and help business grow in the UK and across the globe.""

"A bright orange robot, 10 feet tall, looms over Volkswagen’s new electric car assembly line in central China. It was imported from Germany. The factory’s other 1,074 robots were made in Shanghai. Volkswagen used to import shock absorbers from Central Europe for cars it makes at Chinese factories. Now it buys them from a company in China for 40 percent less. After relying for decades on engineers in Germany to design cars for the Chinese market, Volkswagen has begun hiring for a team of nearly 3,000 Chinese engineers, which will include hundreds transferred from Volkswagen operations elsewhere in China. They will design electric cars at VW’s industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China. The new strategy, which Volkswagen calls “In China, for China,” is another sign of how China’s commanding lead in electric vehicles has upended global auto making. Chinese car brands are appearing more in Germany and throughout Europe, causing politicians to worry about job losses.

"Even with the reduced target it will still make almost 7,000 a month in 2024 It comes as the company sold a record number of units in November: 4,393 Ford is halving production of its fully electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck due to falling demand for EVs. The company's Michigan plant will produce 1,600 a week - half its 3,200 capacity - from January. The price of the truck was cut by around $10,000 in the summer and can now be bought for between around $50,000 and just under $100,000. The decision to limit production - revealed in a memo to dealers seen by Automotive News - comes despite Ford claiming the Lightning is selling faster than ever before. CEO Jim Farley said earlier this month that in November the company sold 4,393, a record for a single month. That is also more than it sold in the entire third quarter, according to company filings. Ford has sold only 20,365 Lightnings so far in 2023, but that is still up from 13,258 in 2022. Ford will halve its production of the F-150 Lightning from 3,200 a week next year to 1,600, according to a recent memo shared with dealers and seen by Automotive News Ford CEO Jim Farley, pictured during the F-150 Lightning's launch in 2022, said earlier this month that in November it sold 4,393 units, a record for a single month Based on 1,600 units a week, DailyMail.com analysis shows the company will still be producing around 6,950 trucks a month - well above even its current record-breaking sales. Ford may be taking into account the widely held theory about electric vehicle sales - that they will dip once the few people that want them have bought them. The automaker's memo to dealers indicated the updated target was spurred by 'changing market demand'. 'There are early adopters, and the early adopters have adopted,' Joe McCabe, president and CEO of automotive consultancy AutoForecast Solutions, recently told DailyMail.com. Various automakers have announced in the second half of the year that they are looking to reduce spending on EV projects. Ford has sold only 20,365 Lightnings so far in 2023, but that is still up from 13,258 in 2022. Pictured is its production line at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan An exterior view of the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center where the automaker produces the F-150 Lightning Thanks in part to billions in subsidies enacted by President Biden, automakers launched ambitious projects to capture the market. Recently, poor EV sales despite those subsidies have forced car makers to reconsider. Ford is not the only automaker to be experiencing issues with meeting electric vehicle sales targets. It was reported earlier this week that Tesla is slashing the price of some of its best-selling vehicles in a last-minute push to boost sales before the end of the year. DailyMail.com wrote to Ford for confirmation of the production figures cited by Automotive News but did not receive a response.

"Apple will introduce a new security mode for iPhones that can protect users when thieves or other attackers learn their private passcode. The feature, Stolen Device Protection, creates a second layer of security, making it harder for thieves to use the passcode to create mischief when the user's phone is not at home or at work. If the phone is at a location that is not usually associated with its owner, and Stolen Device Protection is turned on, the device will require Apple's FaceID facial recognition in addition to a passcode for users to perform sensitive actions, such as viewing stored passwords or wiping the phone. It also adds a delay when changing the user's Apple ID password. The new feature comes after The Wall Street Journal identified a scam in which attackers befriend or spy on their victims, often at bars at night, and get them to reveal their passcode, sometimes by asking to see a photo or by looking over their shoulder. The attacker then steals the phone and uses the purloined passcode to turn off theft protections such as Apple's Activation Lock feature or Lost Mode. A working stolen iPhone is more valuable than one that's locked down through software, which typically needs to be sold for parts. Apple prompts essentially every iPhone user to input a four-digit or six-digit passcode when the device is set up. Before the new function, Apple's privacy and stolen device protections, including its FaceID facial recognition tool, were tied to that passcode, allowing anyone with a stolen device and passcode to take full control of the phone. Stolen Device Mode can be turned on under Face ID and Passcode > Stolen Device Protection for those who have the latest developer beta of iOS, iOS 17.3. The opt-in feature will be shipped to other iPhone users in the coming weeks when iOS 17.3 is launched to the public. ""As threats to user devices continue to evolve, we work tirelessly to develop powerful new protections for our users and their data,"" an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. ""iPhone data encryption has long led the industry, and a thief can't access data on a stolen iPhone without knowing the user's passcode. In the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, Stolen Device Protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection.""

"Creators rejoice: Netflix is finally revealing viewership statistics about nearly all of its shows and movies. Netflix released its first ""What We Watched"" report Tuesday, which ranks almost all of its shows and movies by amount of hours viewed over the last six months. Netflix will release updated reports every six months, the company said. Netflix has long had a reputation for lack of transparency about the popularity of its shows and movies. This has led to some distrust in the creator community, co-CEO Ted Sarandos acknowledged during a conference call with reporters Tuesday. Netflix kept its viewership data private as it built its business so it could experiment while not giving away data to potential competitors, Sarandos said. ""This is the actual data that we use to run the business,"" Sarandos said. ""I'm the co-CEO of a public company, so sharing bad information has consequences."" Netflix now has almost 250 million global subscribers, far outpacing any other streaming service. That's given Sarandos confidence he can be open with viewership statistics. Hollywood actors and writers both mentioned heightened transparency during their strikes earlier this year as they campaigned to be paid in line with how audiences consumed their content. Netflix has also launched an advertising tier that demands more transparency as brands want information about how frequently certain shows and movies are watched. ""This is probably more information than you need, but I think it creates a better environment for the guilds, for us, for the producers, for creators and for the press,"" Sarandos said. ""The Night Agent: Season 1,"" a Netflix original action thriller, was the service's most viewed-show during the past six months, garnering 812 million viewing hours. ""The Mother,"" starring Jennifer Lopez, was the streaming service's top movie. From January to June, 55% of Netflix viewing came from original films and series and 45% from licensed titles, Sarandos said. Netflix revealed viewing information for more than 18,000 titles, accounting for 99% of all its viewing and all titles watched more than 50,000 hours. Read Netflix's report here.

Rina Gonoi, who said she was subjected to persistent harassment after joining the Self-Defense Forces in 2020, alleged the three men pinned her to the ground, pulled her legs apart and pressed their crotches against her in simulation of a sex act in 2021. She complained to her superiors at the time of the incident but later decided to leave the army when no action was taken. Ms Gonoi, now 24, then went public with her accusations in a YouTube video in 2022, a rare move in a conservative society where speaking out against sexual violence has remained largely taboo. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free The video went viral and she collected more than 100,000 signatures for a petition calling on Japan's defence ministry to investigate her case. The defence ministry later issued a public apology and announced that five men connected to the incident had been dismissed and four others punished. The ministry also began a widespread survey of harassment in the military and military-linked entities that found more than 1,400 complaints. Ms Gonoi's fight for justice attracted international recognition, with Time Magazine naming her on its list of 100 emerging world leaders and the BBC including her among its 100 most influential women globally. The defendants seemed to show little expression as the judge read out his verdicts on Tuesday, giving them each a suspended sentence of two years. Advertisement Ms Gonoi told reporters outside the district court in Fukushima: ""I think it was good for Japan's society that the court handed down a guilty verdict and accepted the claims that I've made from the very beginning."" Pausing mid-sentence to regain her composure, she added: ""(The verdict) shows that it's not OK to do things for a laugh, that such acts are an actual crime.""

Chelsea Szendi Schieder, a professor of Japanese history at Tokyo's Aoyama Gakuin University, said: ""The hurdles are incredibly high in Japan to be able to come out publicly and that has to do with...the kind of backlash a woman gets when she speaks out about these issues. ""It is a really important verdict that I hope has a lot of organisations within Japan re-evaluating their internal systems."" Ms Gonoi has also lodged a civil case against her former peers and the government, seeking damages for the alleged assault and the subsequent inaction despite her complaints. The cases come at an awkward time for Japan, which is trying to recruit more women soldiers into its forces and build up its military to deter an increasingly assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea.

"Microsoft on Monday announced a partnership with a major labor group, which represents 60 unions and 12.5 million workers, to create an open discussion on the future of artificial intelligence and quell fears that AI will replace jobs. The partnership with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations comes as Microsoft and other AI providers face increased concern from labor groups and regulatory bodies over how AI will displace workers. The alliance will include AI learning sessions for workers, ""experiential workshops"" focused on niche AI career opportunities between 2024 and 2026 as well as Microsoft-hosted labor summits to incorporate feedback from labor leaders and workers. It has three goals: ""Sharing in-depth information with labor leaders and workers on AI technology trends."" ""Incorporating worker perspectives and expertise in the development of AI technology. ""Helping shape public policy that supports the technology skills and needs of frontline workers."" AI providers have increased their responses to public pressure and questioning on how their technologies may affect workers. That may be partly due to increasing fears that new technologies could be used to perform jobs currently performed by humans. A September Gallup poll showed that 1 in 5 college-educated workers worries tech could make their jobs obsolete, up seven percentage points from 2021. Amazon said in October it would work with MIT ""to better understand how employees and organizations are affected"" by AI and robotics as Amazon employees expressed growing concern over pressure to perform and meet quotas. In May, IBM announced plans to replace about 8,000 jobs with AI, but CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC the company is prioritizing ""massively upskilling all of our employees on AI,"" and he foresees the technology mostly replacing back-office functions. The tech giants' moves come alongside the threat of increasing regulation. In October, President Joe Biden's first-ever executive order on AI included a section on supporting workers amid AI advancement, namely by producing a report on the potential labor market implications of AI and studying the ways the federal government could support workers affected by a disruption to the labor market. The executive order also outlined a plan to develop principles and best practices to ""mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers,"" with a focus on job displacement, labor standards and workplace equity.

"Wells Fargo was snared in an industrywide probe into mortgage bankers' use of loan discounts last year, CNBC has learned. The discounts, known as pricing exceptions, are used by mortgage personnel to help secure deals in competitive markets. At Wells Fargo, for instance, bankers could request pricing exceptions that typically lowered a customer's APR by between 25 abd 75 basis points. The practice, used for decades across the home loan industry, has triggered regulators' interest in recent years over possible violations of U.S. fair lending laws. Black and female borrowers got fewer pricing exceptions than other customers, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has found. ""As long as pricing exceptions exist, pricing disparities exist,"" said Ken Perry, founder of a Washington-based compliance firm for the mortgage industry. ""They're the easiest way to discriminate against a client."" Wells Fargo received an official notice from the CFPB called an MRA, or Matter Requiring Attention, on problems with its discounts, said people with knowledge of the situation. It's unclear if regulators accused the bank of discrimination or sloppy oversight. The bank's internal investigation on the matter extended into late this year, said the people. Wells Fargo, until recently the biggest player in U.S. mortgages, has repeatedly felt regulators' wrath over missteps involving home loans. In 2012, it paid more than $184 million to settle federal claims that it charged minorities higher fees and unjustly put them into subprime loans. It was fined $250 million in 2021 for failing to address problems in its mortgage business, and more recently paid $3.7 billion for consumer abuses on products including home loans. The behind-the-scenes actions by regulators at Wells Fargo, which hadn't been reported before, happened in the months before the company announced it was reining in its mortgage business. One reason for that move was the heightened scrutiny on lenders since the 2008 financial crisis. Wells Fargo later hired law firm Winston & Strawn to grill mortgage bankers whose sales included high levels of the discounts, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about confidential matters.

"British Airways bosses have apologised for telling cabin crew members what bras to wear under new 'transparent' uniforms which led to comments from passengers. The see-through blouses were issued as part of a new uniform, unveiled earlier this year, designed to 'take the airline into the next chapter' and for a non-binary crew. Last year BA relaxed the rules around its strict uniform policy and went gender-neutral to allow male pilots and crew to wear make-up and carry handbags. Although the new uniforms were gendered, BA's policy now allows staff who identify as a certain gender to wear that clothing. BA heralded the launch as 'marking a new era' for the airline, but now some of its female staff have hit out at the 'cheap' look of the uniform, while others have described the uniforms as 'deliberately androgynous'. The new uniforms were tested in secret trials last year and finally launched across its workforce in October. British Airways staff show off their new uniforms. The airline has a policy which allows staff who identify as a certain gender to wear that clothing Crew members complained that the new uniforms led to some passengers commenting on their underwear which could be seen through blouses British Airways unveiled the new uniform for the first time in nearly 20 years in January, with the collection of garments set to 'take the airline into its next chapter' But, crew members complained that the new uniforms, which included a 'modern jumpsuit', skirt and trouser options for women and a tailored three-piece suit for men with regular and slim-fit style trousers, led to some passengers commenting on their underwear which could be seen through blouses. Female staff had threatened to walk out over the 'humiliating fiasco', leading to union officials input. Staff shared snaps of the underwear clearly visible beneath the uniforms, designed by British fashion designer Ozwald Boateng, online. According to the Sun, crew members have been humiliated after being 'asked multiple questions by travellers about their bra'. Previous official guidance suggested that 'undergarments should be plain white or nude, with no lace, patterns or writing'. But bosses have now backed down, removing the stipulations on what underwear staff wear. The British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association told staff: 'The eagle eyes amongst you may have noticed that the 'Underwear' Standard that was somehow to be ­applied to Female Ground Staff and Cabin Crew, has mysteriously but thankfully disappeared. 'That we even had to raise this issue at all beggars belief.' The airline told The Sun: 'We've removed a recommendation from our uniform guidelines and will continue to listen to our colleagues about what works best for them.'

"A union representative claims they were barred from inspecting a McDonald's after workers complained about seeing rats at the restaurant for six weeks. Employees at the Hindley Street McDonald's, in Adelaide, reported 'almost daily' rat sightings to their union who sent a representative on December 8 to investigate. A new report published by SafeWork SA alleges that the rep was left waiting outside for 'an hour or two' after arriving at 12:15pm and eventually left. Workers at the diner have claimed that faulty wiring, falling ceiling tiles and the 'rat infestation' had created an unsafe work environment. A McDonalds spokesperson said that it is now in direct contact with the franchisee of the Hindley Street store regarding allegations made in the report. The Maccas on Hindley Street in Adelaide's CBD has been infested with rats for weeks, according to employees who have blown the whistle to the SDA (pictured rat in storage room) The workers allege that rats are seen 'almost daily' and that they have been caught 'nibbling' on the burger buns (pictured) One worker who wished to remain anonymous told The Advertiser that rat sightings and safety issues had become a normal part of the workplace.

The worker added that they once found a dead rat in the store and that photos had been taken of another rat nibbling cheese off of the floor in the storage area. Recently the kitchen also flooded due to a hole in the roof which workers were told to ignore and 'just keep working' through. Employees also complained of a lack of air-conditioning and inadequate supervision during weekend shifts. All of these concerns were reported to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) who sent a representative to confirm the allegations. The rep was initially denied entry by management at the store who asked them to wait 'for an hour or two' which the union deemed a 'refusal of entry'. SafeWork SA has confirmed that it was 'aware of the allegations and is conducting inquiries' of its own. A union representative was sent to investigate the allegations on December 8 but was refused entry by management at the rest (pictured) SDA secretary Josh Peak said that the restaurant had denied the union its 'legal right to investigate a rat infestation that was posing a risk to worker and consumer safety'. 'McDonald's should not be attempting to cover up health and safety concerns,' he said in a statement. 'Workers and consumers deserve to know that their workplaces and the products they sell are safe.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's stressed that the fast food chain took 'safety, cleanliness and hygiene very seriously'. '[We] and expect our restaurants to follow our strict cleaning, sanitisation and hygiene procedures at all times, including pest control,' they said. 'This clearly falls short of those standards, and we are addressing this directly with the franchisee and restaurant. 'McDonald's Australia [also] does not accept or condone 'anti-union' conduct within our business or franchisee-owned restaurants.'

"A group of current and former prisoners are suing Alabama state alleging they made $450million by forcing them to work in fast food chains for 'next to nothing'. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday at the Middle District Court, claims the prisoners were forced into a 'modern-day form of slavery' by the state. It says they were 'entrapped in a system of ‘convict leasing’ in which incarcerated people are forced to work, often for little or no money' while the state kept the profits of their labor. The plaintiffs said they are regularly forced to work at McDonald’s, KFC, Wendy’s, and Burger King franchises, Anheuser-Busch distributors, and meat processors. According to the complaint, inmates, 'live in a constant danger of being murdered, stabbed, or raped... and if they refuse to work, the State punishes them even more.' Robert Earl Council, is an incarcerated activist who cofounded the Free Alabama Movement, a group that helped organize a 2016 nationwide strike among incarcerated people The lawsuit accuses government agencies - including the Alabama Department of Corrections - and over two dozen state officials, including Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall, of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Alabama makes $450 million a year from forced labor, according to the complaint, which says since 2018, 575 private employers and over 100 public employers have 'leased' labor from Alabama prisons. It says the inmates work against their will in 'unsafe work conditions' and the ADOC takes 40 percent of gross earnings claiming it is ‘to assist in defraying the cost of his/her incarceration'. In September 2023, the complaint says 1,374 incarcerated people were enrolled in the work program. One of the individuals involved in the complaint, Lakiera Walker, was imprisoned from 2007 to 2023. She said she was forced to perform long hours of uncompensated work 'upon threat of discipline'. Her jobs included housekeeping, stripping floors, providing care for mentally disabled or other ill incarcerated people, unloading chemical trucks, working inside freezers, and at Burger King. She said she was paid just $2 per day and was subjected to sexual harassment by a supervising officer. When she was so ill she could not work, she said a supervisor told her to 'get up and go make us our 40 percent'. She told Law&Crime: 'Those women need help. They really need a voice. I knew I had to do something. I want justice for this forced labor.' Lakiera Walker, was imprisoned from 2007 to 2023 and said she was made to work long hours for just $2 a day on 'threat of discipline' Alimireo English, a plaintiff against the Alabama Department of Corrections, has been incarcerated for 13 years, he regularly works 15-hour shifts, 7 days a week The complaint alleges that if prisoners do not comply with the rules they risk being 'put behind the wall' in one of the 'higher-security ultra-violent facilities'. Plaintiffs argued that Alabama’s practices are illegal under both the Alabama and US Constitutions and asked that the court award compensatory and punitive damages. One of the plaintiffs, Robert Earl Council, is an incarcerated activist who cofounded the Free Alabama Movement, a group that helped organize a 2016 nationwide strike among incarcerated people. The complaint says he has been 'subject to severe and abusive treatment in retaliation for advocating that incarcerated persons refuse to submit to forced labor'. He told Law&Crime: 'Alabama seems to be addicted to cheap labor.' The full list of plaintiffs is: Robert Earl Council, Lee Edward Moore Jr., Lakiera Walker, Jerame Apprentice Cole, Frederick Denard McDole, Michael Campbell, Arthur Charles Ptomey Jr., Lanair Pritchett, Alimireo English, and Toni Cartwright. Arthur Charles Promey Jr, has been incarcerated for 16 years - he was denied parole in 2022, with ADOC allegedly telling his family it was because 'he was fired from KFC in 2019.' This was despite his KFC manager writing 'a letter to the Parole Board specifically recommending him for parole in light of his strong work performance'.

"A judge has ordered the BBC to release a large number of emails in relation to Martin Bashir's now infamous 1995 interview with Princess Diana. The emails all relate to a period in 2020 when the broadcaster was dealing with the scandal around the interview. They were initially requested via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by Andrew Webb - a journalist and filmmaker who has been investigating the scandal.

"The Air Force has disciplined 15 members of the Air National Guard after a 'lack of supervision' allowed Jack Texeira to share hundreds of classified documents on the social media platform Discord. Jack Texeira, a first class airman with the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was accused of leaking the highly classified military documents from the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base. The April disclosure was described as 'one of the biggest leaks of US intelligence' material in history. Texeira, who worked as a cyber defense operations journeyman, considered a low-ranking job, was charged with six counts of retaining and transmitting classified information. An internal investigation revealed a 'lack of supervision' and a 'culture of complacency' in the massive classified documents leak that took place, The Washington Post reported. On Monday, the Air Force Inspector General reported that multiple officials intentionally failed to take required action on Texeira's suspicious behavior. Jack Texeira, 21, (pictured) worked as a cyber defence operations journeyman, considered a low-ranking job, was charged with six counts of retaining and transmitting classified information, the BBC reported The US Department of Justice released photo evidence collected during the investigation into US Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who is accused of leaking classified documents online The Inspector General alleged that his superiors failed to restrict his access to classified systems and facilities and to alert appropriate authorities during the time that he was alleged to have been illegally sharing government secrets. He shared top secret military secrets he illegally collected from his intelligence unit with other Discord users, authorities said. He carried this out allegedly by first typing out classified documents he accessed and then sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. The punitive actions range from relieving personnel from their positions, including command positions, to non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It was revealed according to an Air Force report that officers were 'aware of his intelligence-seeking activities' and failed to stop him. It also revealed that none of his supervisors knew the full extent of Teixeira's online activities.

"Global alternative asset and private equity investor KKR announced the release of its 2024 Global Macro Outlook, identifying decarbonization, and the large scale “brown-to-green” transition of asset-heavy sectors in particular, as a key “mega-theme” driving investment opportunities. In the report by Henry McVey, CIO of KKR’s Balance Sheet and Head of Global Macro and Asset Allocation, KKR notes that while decarbonization efforts to date have been primarily focused on “asset light” technology-driven advances, investments going forward that aim to enable at-scale climate impact will likely be “much more asset-heavy in nature,” generating large scale opportunities targeting the larger, more emissions intensive sectors of the global economy. Specifically, the report to opportunities created by the “requirements for decarbonizing the traditional power generation, property, transportation, and industrial sectors,” in addition to the need to upgrade global supply chains, buildings and data centers. The report follows a series of climate-focused and sector decarbonization moves by KKR, including the launch in August of a global climate strategy team, which the firm said marked an expansion on its focus on climate investing, as well as recent investments including a $750 million allocation to transport and grid decarbonization solutions company Zenobē, and the $1.7 billion acquisition earlier this month of energy and electrification solutions company Smart Metering Systems (SMS). The report also highlights climate-related opportunities from the emergence of AI technologies, and of new forms of energy that “will require the footprint of energy distribution to be reworked,” adding: “This reconfiguration represents a major opportunity for both Infrastructure and parts of Private Equity, we believe.” Additional mega-themes highlighted by the outlook report included “Industrial Automation,” “Security of Everything,” Intra-Asia Connectivity,” “Labor Productivity/Work Force Development,” and “Artificial Intelligence.” Click here to access the report.

In a letter to Lynne Fox, the president of the Workers United union, Starbucks Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly said the current bargaining impasse between the two sides “should not be acceptable to either of us.” Kelly asked to restart bargaining in January. “We will set as an ambition and hopeful goal the completion of bargaining and the ratification of contracts in 2024,” Kelly wrote in the letter. In a statement distributed by Workers United, Fox said she is reviewing the letter and will respond. “We’ve never said no to meeting with Starbucks. Anything that moves bargaining forward in a positive way is most welcome,” Fox said. Workers United said the last bargaining session between the two sides was May 23. Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of a Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, voting to unionize. It was the first company-owned store to join a union in more than three decades. Since then, at least 370 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board. There are about 10,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. Workers say they're seeking higher pay, more consistent schedules and more say in issues like store safety and workload during busy times. Seattle-based Starbucks has said its stores run more efficiently if it can work directly with its employees and not through a third party.

"A top Tesla executive has revealed the company is working on wireless charging for its cars during an appearance on Jay Leno's Garage. While introducing the talk show host to Tesla's new Cybertruck, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen claimed the company was developing charging pads - similar to the technology used to wirelessly charge smartphones. 'We're working on inductive charging - you don't even need to plug something in at that point,' said von Holzhausen. 'Just pull into your garage and drive over the pad and you're charging.' While wireless car charging is expected to improve convenience for traditional owners, it is also considered important for the rollout of automated taxis, where self-driving cars would ferry around passengers without supervision. Von Holzhausen (right) is seen during an episode of Jay Leno's Garage introducing Leno (left) to Tesla's new Cybertruck In March Tesla showed a rendering of a black pad underneath the rear part of a Tesla Model S parked inside a garage, providing an initial indication that inductive charging was in the works In that scenario, there would be no need for a human or a robot to pick up the charging cable and insert it into the car. In March, in a slide during a presentation to investors, Tesla showed a mocked-up image of a black pad underneath the rear part of a Tesla parked inside a garage. A black pad is connected by a wire to a unit mounted on the garage wall. Von Holzhausen described a similar method during his appearance on Leno's show. In July, Tesla spent $76 million on Wiferion, a German wireless charging startup known for inductive charging for fork lift trucks, among other vehicles. Another clue as to the what a charging pad might look like - and how it works - can be seen in a video by a company called WiTricity, a company which Wiferion singed a 'global licensing agreement' with in 2022. WiTricity had previously presented a prototype of a system that could wirelessly charge a Tesla Model 3 - see the video below. In October, Tesla sold Wiferion. Tesla blog Tesmanian reported at the time that the purpose of the purchase was to acquire talent in the field of inductive charging. Tesla has long expressed interest in inductive charging. Recently it released a small $300 charging pad for consumer electronics that can charge three devices at once. Engineering inductive chargers can be challenging because losses of energy are hard to mitigate. After Apple spent years attempting to bring the AirPower charging mat to the market it eventually canceled it, citing 'high standards'. While inductive chargers may be coming, they are not particularly urgent. As it stands, installing them in a garage is significantly more expensive than a traditional charger and speeds are comparatively slow.

"DHL Group’s contract logistics division DHL Supply Chain announced today the launch of a new global Green Transport Policy, aimed at setting a global sustainability standard for its transport fleet and substantially reducing emissions, and including a has commitment to invest an additional €200 million (USD$217 million) in investment in fossil fuel alternatives over the next three years. The release of the new policy follows the launch in 2021 by DHL of its Sustainability Roadmap, which included plans to invest €7 billion over ten years in measures to reduce its CO2 emissions, with a focus on the expansion of the zero-emission e-vehicle fleet, alternative aviation fuels, and climate-neutral buildings. According to DHL Supply Chain CEO Oscar de Bok, under the company’s plans, 30% of the unit’s fleet will run on sustainable fuels by 2026. In addition to the €200 million investment, the new policy will also see an initial move to transition around 2,000 of its vehicles from conventional combustion engines to alternatives including hydrotreated vegetable oil, biogas, electric or hydrogen. DHL said that the new investments will reduce close to 300,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to offsetting the CO2 emissions produced by 2,200 trucks, each driving a daily distance of 500 kilometers, over the course of one year. The Green Transport Policy provides guidance on the most suitable greener alternative based on factors such as availability, infrastructure, and cost per market, the company said. At the outset, this new policy will target its investments in 17 countries with the highest emissions footprint, accounting for 94% of the emissions from DHL Supply Chain’s own fleet within the transportation sector. Bok said:

"Amazon's AWS cloud unit has announced new chips for customers to build and run artificial intelligence applications on, as well as plans to offer access to Nvidia's latest chips. Amazon Web Services is trying to stand out as a cloud provider with a variety of cost-effective options. It won't just sell cheap Amazon-branded products, though. Just as in its online retail marketplace, Amazon's cloud will feature top-of-the-line products from other vendors, including highly sought after GPUs from top AI chipmaker Nvidia . Demand for Nvidia GPUs has skyrocketed since startup OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot last year, wowing people with its abilities to summarize information and compose human-like text. It led to a shortage of Nvidia's chips as companies raced to incorporate similar generative AI technologies into their products. Amazon's dual-pronged approach of both building its own chips and letting customers access Nvidia's latest chips might will help it against its top cloud computing competitor, Microsoft. Earlier this month, Microsoft took a similar approach by revealing its inaugural AI chip, the Maia 100, and also saying the Azure cloud will have Nvidia H200 GPUs. The announcements came at the Reinvent conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Specifically, AWS said it will offer access to Nvidia's latest H200 AI graphics processing units. It also announced its new Trainium2 artificial intelligence chip and the general-purpose Graviton4 processor. The new Nvidia GPU is an upgrade from the H100, the chip OpenAI used to train its most advanced large language model, GPT-4. Big companies, startups and government agencies are all vying for a limited supply of the chips, meaning there's high demand for renting them out from cloud providers like Amazon as well. Nvidia has said the H200 will generate output nearly twice as fast as the H100. Amazon's own Trainium2 chips are built for training AI models, including the sort that AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and its competitors run on. Startup Databricks and Amazon-backed Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor, plan to build models with the new Trainium2 chips, which will boast four times better performance than the original model, Amazon said. The Graviton4 processors are based on Arm architecture and consume less energy than chips from Intel or AMD . Graviton4 promises 30% better performance than the existing Graviton3 chips, enabling what AWS said is better output for the price. Inflation has been higher than usual, inspiring central bankers to hike interest rates. Organizations that want to keep using AWS but lower their cloud bills to better deal with the economy might wish to consider moving to Graviton. More than 50,000 AWS customers are already using Graviton chips, Amazon said. Finally, as part of its deepening relationship with Nvidia, AWS said it will operate more than 16,000 Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, which contain Nvidia GPUs and Nvidia's Arm-based general-purpose processors. Nvidia's own research and development group and AWS customers will both be able to take advantage of this infrastructure. AWS has launched more than 200 cloud products since 2006, when it released its EC2 and S3 services for computing and storing data. Not all of them have been hits. Some go without updates for a long time and a rare few are discontinued, freeing up Amazon to reallocate resources. However, the company continues to invest in the Graviton and Trainium programs, suggesting that Amazon senses demand. AWS didn't announce release dates for virtual-machine instances with Nvidia H200 chips, nor instances relying on its Trainium2 silicon. Customers can start testing Graviton4 virtual-machine instances now before they become commercially available in the next few months. WATCH: Analysts are going to have to raise their AWS growth estimates, says Deepwater's Gene Munster

"Amazon was quieter about its A.I. plans until more recently. In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems. As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private. Many companies “told me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns,” he said. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.

"The Air Traffic Control tower is seen at the Miami International Airport on September 25, 2023 in Miami, Florida. American Airlines aims to remove carbon from the atmosphere by working with a startup that stores bricks of plant material underground. The airline announced a deal with Graphyte on Tuesday to purchase credits equivalent to 10,000 tons of permanent carbon removal with delivery scheduled for early 2025. American is Graphyte's first commercial customer. Graphyte uses a process called carbon casting that converts byproducts from the agriculture and timber industries such as wood bark, rice hulls and plant stalks which have captured carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The plant material is dried to prevent decomposition and then converted into carbon dense bricks that are sealed with a polymer barrier. These bricks are stored in underground chambers and monitored with sensors to make sure the carbon does not escape, according to the company. American aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but the aviation industry has few viable solutions right now to reduce its impact on the climate. American has invested in hydrogen as an alternative fuel but it won't be commercially viable for years to come. """"Hard to abate industries like aviation will need high-quality, permanent, affordable and scalable carbon credits – including removals – to achieve our emissions reduction goals,"""" said Jill Blickstein, American's chief sustainability officer, in statement Tuesday. Plant byproducts from the agriculture and timber industries are typically burned or left to decompose, which returns carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This biomass material is equivalent to 3 billion tons of potential carbon dioxide removal annually, according to Graphyte. Graphyte says carbon casting is a cheap, scalable alternative to expensive and technologically intensive methods of carbon capture and removal. The company is backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an investment firm founded by Bill Gates that funds clean energy technologies. Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:

"More than 4% of GDP could be lost annually due to the physical impact of climate change, if temperature increase exceeds 2°C, with developing nations significantly more exposed and less prepared, according to a new study released by S&P Global Ratings. For the report, “Lost GDP: Potential Impacts Of Physical Climate Risks,” S&P Global examined a series of climate scenarios for projected greenhouse gas emissions and temperature changes, assessing the potential exposure of 137 countries to economic losses caused by the physical impacts of climate change, focused on seven specific climate hazards, ranging from extreme heat and flooding to wildfires and storms. S&P Global noted that the report comes as natural disasters are already leading to greater economic impact, with statistics provided by Swiss Re revealing a 5% – 7% annual growth in annua insured losses from 1992 – 2022. Under a “slow transition” scenario in which temperature increase is anticipated to reach 2.1°C by 2050, the report indicates that up to 4.4% of the world’s GDP could be lost annually,, absent adaptation measures, with the bulk of the impact – roughly 60% of the total – driven by water stress and extreme heat, which in combination could result in depleted water resources, increased energy demand, disruption to agricultural production, and a greater risk of wildfires. The report found that developing regions would be substantially more heavily impacted by climate hazards, with lower income countries 4.4x more exposed to climate risks that their wealthier counterparts, and less prepared to address economic losses. Under the slow transition scenario, the report found that South Asia has the greatest exposure to climate change, with approximately 12% of GDP at risk annually by 2050, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, and North Africa (MENA), each with 8% of GDP at risk, while GDP at risk in North America and Europe is under 2%. The report also utilized a readiness assessment metric, measuring the ability of countries to avoid, respond to, and recover from physical climate risks, which found that North America and Europe, the least exposed to physical climate risk were also by far the most prepared, while Sub-Saharan Africa is the least prepared region to face losses from climate hazards, and lower income areas broadly scoring well below their higher income peers. While noting the need to invest in climate adaptation to address these risks, the report also notes barriers to funding adaptation measures, with most adaptation finance provided in the form of debt instruments, while finance conditions are tightening, and may become worse in an environment of higher interest rates.

"Roomba robot vacuums made by iRobot are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on August 05, 2022 in San Rafael, California. Shares of iRobot plunged as much as 19% on Monday after the EU's antitrust watchdog issued a warning that Amazon 's planned $1.7 billion acquisition of the Roomba maker raises competition concerns. The European Commission opened an in-depth probe into the purchase in July, and is expected to rule on the deal by Feb. 14. In a statement Monday, the commission said it has informed Amazon of its """"preliminary view that its proposed acquisition of iRobot may restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners."""" An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company continues to work with the commission on addressing concerns identified in its probe. """"iRobot, which faces intense competition from other vacuum cleaner suppliers, offers practical and inventive products,"""" the spokesperson said. """"We believe Amazon can offer a company like iRobot the resources to accelerate innovation and invest in critical features while lowering prices for consumers."""" iRobot shares were briefly halted earlier Monday afternoon following the announcement. Amazon shares were up about 1.4%. The deal is also under review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority said in June the deal would not result in """"a substantial lessening of competition"""" in the U.K. Amazon announced its intention to acquire iRobot in August 2022 for $61 a share in an all-cash deal. The commission's announcement comes after iRobot shares rocketed 39% on Friday after Reuters reported the deal is set to """"win unconditional EU antitrust approval,"""" citing three sources familiar with the matter. An EU spokesperson declined to comment. In its update Monday, the commission said it found that Amazon may have the ability to prevent or degrade iRobot rivals' access to its online site by delisting or reducing the visibility of their products in search results, or in other highly visible areas such as the """"other products you may like"""" section on a listing. Officials said Amazon may have the incentive to """"foreclose iRobot's rivals because it may be economically profitable to do so.

"BBC journalists have accused the broadcasters of favouritism towards Israel and only using 'atrocity' and 'massacre' to refer to Hamas attacks. Eight UK-based staff wrote a 2,300-word letter to Al Jazeera in which they claimed the corporation had failed to 'humanise Palestinian victims' of the war. It is the latest salvo against the corporation from the pro-Palestinian side after supporters of Israel slammed it for failing to refer to Hamas as 'terrorists'. The eight employees, who asked Al Jazeera not to share their identities, accused the BBC of being guilty of a 'double standard in how civilians are seen'. They said: 'The BBC has failed to accurately tell this story – through omission and lack of critical engagement with Israel's claims – and it has therefore failed to help the public engage with and understand the human rights abuses unfolding in Gaza. Eight UK-based BBC staff wrote a 2,300-word letter to Al Jazeera in which they claimed the corporation had failed to 'humanise Palestinian victims' of the war 'News updates and articles neglect to include a line or two of critical historical context – on 75 years of occupation, the Nakba, or the asymmetric death toll across decades.'

The BBC said its coverage of the war 'has made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Gaza and Israel'. Last week former BBC television chief Danny Cohen said the BBC was 'fuelling antisemitism' by failing to refer to Hamas as terrorists and describing the October 7 massacre as a 'cross-border attack'. He described the broadcaster's choice of verbiage as 'offensive' and 'reductionist' as he called for a probe into an alleged antisemitism and anti-Israel bias at the BBC. But the eight journalists who wrote to Al Jazeera claimed terms like 'massacre' and 'atrocity' were reserved 'only for Hamas, framing the group as the only instigator and perpetrator of violence in the region'. They said that the Hamas attack on October 7, 'while appalling and devastating… does not justify the indiscriminate killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the BBC cannot be seen to support – or fail to interrogate – the logic that it does.' One of the BBC's highest profile critics during the war has been Israeli president Isaac Herzog, who called the organisation 'atrocious' for describing Hamas terrorists as 'militants'. A man salvages objects amid the rubble of a school hit during an Israeli strike on the Gaza Strip He said: 'I feel the BBC's reporting is atrocious. 'The fact that it does not recognise Hamas as a terror organisation requires a complete legal battle and public battle. It's unbelievable. 'What other type of torture do they want before they decide it was a terrorist organisation?' The corporation has been criticised for some of its reporting during the war, including one correspondent's decision to blame the blast at the Al Ahli hospital on October 18 on an Israel airstrike.  A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC is one of the only news organisations to have journalists inside Gaza, and our journalists have been able to provide on the ground reporting, first-hand testimony and analysis on what is happening on the ground,' a spokesman said. Last week former BBC television chief Danny Cohen said the BBC was 'fuelling antisemitism' by failing to refer to Hamas as terrorists 'This has included many stories of Palestinian victims and first-hand testimony from civilians, doctors and aid workers in Gaza, as well as a Panorama documentary, featuring human stories from both sides.

"Spotify says 'drains' on its $40bn royalty pool 'have now reached a tipping point' A shake-up of Spotify's royalty model has sparked concerns that smaller artists could be left even worse off under the streaming giant's new compensation strategy. Spotify revealed major changes to its royalty model this week designed to ensure the more than $40billion (£32billion) its dolls out each year 'is going to the people our platform is designed to enable: emerging and professional artists'. It told its artists that 'drains' on its royalty pool 'have now reached a tipping point', revealing new policies to 'deter artificial streaming...better distribute small payments that aren’t reaching artists...and rein in those attempting to game the system with noise'. Doing so, it says, will drive around $1billion in revenue toward 'emerging and professional artists over the next five years'. The Stockholm-based company will make it tougher for artist to make money from the platform and will instead distribute more money to major labels and artists How is Spotify tackling the 'drains' on its royalty pool? Music artists make the bulk of income outside of live performances via streaming platforms. Essentially, the more times fans stream their work, the more money they will earn. From early next year, a Spotify track must have reached at least 1,000 streams in the previous 12 months in order to generate recorded royalties. The group will also charge labels and distributors per track when Spotify finds examples of 'flagrant' artificial streaming, while it is increasing the minimum track length of 'functional noise recordings' to two minutes. General secretary of the Musicians' Union, which represents the interests of 33,000 UK musicians, Naomi Pohl told This is Money: 'Platforms changing their model following negotiation with major labels is concerning. 'While the model purports to be """"artist centric"""" it will in fact divert money from emerging artists towards major artists and of course the labels themselves.' Pohl also expressed her frustration at the changes being made without any negotiation with artists or artists' representative bodies. She added: 'We have been promised a Government-convened working group on creator remuneration from music streaming so this is the sort of proposal that could and should have been proposed there, rather than implemented unilaterally.' But not everyone agrees that the new royalty model hurts smaller artists... President of distribution platform Stem, Kristin Graziani disagrees that the new minimum streaming threshold will leave early career artists at a disadvantage. In a guest essay for New York-based magazine Consequence, she argued that because 1000 streams a year equates to just $3 in earnings, the impact is minimal. She added: '$3.00 is well below the threshold at which almost every distributor allows artists to transfer earnings into their own bank accounts. In other words, this is money that isn’t currently making it to artists in the first place. 'Right now, artists don’t benefit from the millions of tiny payments that Spotify pays for content that receives a few streams per month. It’s the distributors who benefit from the hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in their bank accounts earning interest.' How does Spotify make its money? Spotify, which is the word's most popular audio streaming subscription service, primarily makes its money through its Premium Services as well as Ad-Supported Services. Its monthly active user base was up by 26 per cent to 574million listeners in the third quarter, which it said last month was 2 million ahead of its guidance. Spotify also posted profits of over £28million, the first quarterly profit the company has managed since 2021. Subscribers grew by 16 per cent year-to-year to 226 million, with total revenue up 11 per cent to around £3billion which also exceeded guidance. This is despite it raising its prices for the first time in the UK earlier this year. The company said it would charge £10.99 a month for its premium service, up from £9.99. This followed similar moves by rivals such as Apple Music. Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, told This Is Money: 'Spotify and streaming have near single handedly driven the renaissance of the global recorded music industry after its near-death experience a decade ago. 'It's become an affordable essential service for music-loving Generation Z, who have led the strong 16% per cent recent growth in its paid premium service. This accounts for near 90 per cent of its sales, and comes despite the economic slowdown and cost-of-living headwinds and broader subscription service fatigue. 'Their podcast expansion has been a costly detour but the growth outlook remains strong, with overall listeners growing 26 per cent, only 40 per cent subscribed to the premium service, and half the user base still in just the US and UK.' How much do Spotify and rivals Apple and Amazon Music pay artists? Like Spotify, rivals Apple Music and Amazon Music rely heavily on subscriptions to generate profits. While Spotify is clear its model does not compensate artists on a per-stream basis, it's compensation model is understood to work out at $0.003 to $0.005 per play. This is significantly less than the $0.01 per stream that Apple Music revealed it pays artists in 2020. However, this value is also an average, with the amount depending on the subscription plan and country or region. Amazon Music also reportedly pays more than Spotify. The internet retail giant is rumored to pay artists between $0.004 and $0.007 per stream.

"READ MORE: Men less likely to become teachers or nurses due to gender bias It's thought to be because this allows women to be seen as more confident A wealth of research shows that women apologize far more often than men - even when they've done nothing wrong. And now a new study shows that, at least in the workplace, they've been saying sorry all wrong. According to new research by scientists at the University of Arizona, apologizing in an assertive, typically masculine way will get you further in the workplace. In a series of four studies, researchers asked 800 male and female participants to judge a series of different written apologies written by real people. Participants were asked to consider how genuine they thought the apology was, and whether it would make them more or less inclined to want to work with the apologizer. Women who apologized with more assertive language received better responses, and men who used more feminine language gained more sympathy for being seen as 'sensitive'  They found that women who used more assertive, 'masculine' language were rated more highly. They identified the same pattern: assertive apologies from women received more 'likes' and positive comments from tweeters. Sarah Doyle, study author and a professor in the Department of Management and Organizations at the University of Arizona, said: 'We found that women delivering masculine-style apologies benefited because they were seen as enhancing their perceived competence.' The first of several studies involved examining 87 apology tweets from celebrities like Lizzo, Kevin Hart, Tyler Posey, and Kendra Wilkinson. Dr Doyle said that tweets violating gender stereotypes received an average of 17,000 more likes on the platform and more positive sentiments from the public. In the second study, 336 working adults were asked to imagine their accountant had emailed them apologizing for a mistake on their taxes. Participants were randomly assigned to groups classified by the accountant delivering a stereotypically masculine or feminine apology. The subjects were then asked to rate how likely they were to keep working with the accountant. The researchers found that participants were more likely to keep using a female accountant who delivered an typically masculine apology. Interestingly, breaking gender stereotypes appeared to be equally beneficial for men. Men who apologized like women were eight percent more effective. 'The men delivering apologies with more stereotypically feminine language were seen as having greater interpersonal sensitivity that enhanced their perceived benevolence or warmth,' the study authors said. Dr Doyle said: 'It's important to mention that we did not find that men and women are penalized for giving a stereotypical apology.' 'Rather, they benefit from giving a counter-stereotypical one. Thus, any apology is likely to be better than no apology at all.' The team hopes to use the results to examine how communication can be improved beyond apologizing. 'Much of the literature suggests women apologize too much and men don't apologize enough,' Dr Doyle said. 'It's not just about whether people should apologize more or less, but how we can construct apologies differently. It's what you include in that apology that's really going to matter.'

"The BBC has sparked anger after it included a transgender woman on its annual 100 Women list for 2023. Critics claimed the decision to include activist Rukshana Kapali, from Nepal, on the list of ‘inspiring’ and ‘influential’ women was not ‘fair’ and ‘insulting’, with accusations the inclusion made the list ‘meaningless’. This year’s list includes a selection of women from many different fields, including well-known figures such as Michelle Obama and Amal Clooney. In its entry for the list, the BBC described Kapali as a ‘housing campaigner’ and a ‘transgender human rights activist’. Rukshana Kapali from Nepal, pictured, has been described by the BBC as a 'transgender human rights activist' and included on a list of the year's 100 most inspiring women Her inclusion on the list has received criticism for 'taking a place away from another biological woman' The description said she had ‘embarked on her own path of self-education around the diversity of gender and sexuality’ and ‘came out as a teenager’ and had been ‘vocal on social media on issues around queer rights’. It added that the third-year law student was involved in advancing ‘legal and constitutional rights for LGBTQ+ people in Nepal’. She comes from ‘a historically marginalised caste’ called the Jugi, within the Newa ethnicity and fights against this group’s forced evictions from traditional homes. But the corporation’s decision to include her on the list, which first launched in 2013, has not gone down well with women’s rights activists and others. One woman, who advocates for ‘women’s sex based rights’ attacked the decision, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter: ‘But you have taken a place away from another biological women. This isn’t right or fair.’ The description said she had ‘embarked on her own path of self-education around the diversity of gender and sexuality’ and ‘came out as a teenager’ and had been ‘vocal on social media on issues around queer rights’ They told the BBC to ‘stop taking opportunities away from women’. Another critic added: ‘WHY include a male in @BBC100women 2023 list? ‘Surely it's easy to compile a list of 100 influential & inspiring WOMEN from around the world. Kapali could be recognised for his work to further LGBTQ rights but #BBC100Women isn't the list for him - It's for WOMEN.’ Responding to one of the BBC’s social media posts on the list, another woman replied: ‘Except you had to include at least one man. How insulting. Men are better women than woman according to BBC.’ One said including a ‘man’ on the list ‘makes the whole thing meaningless for the amazing actual women on there’. Last year the BBC faced a similar row when it included two transgender activists on the 100 Women list. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Transgender women have previously been featured on the BBC 100 Women list many times, since the very first BBC 100 Women season was launched in 2013. The BBC 100 Women list also featured a transgender activist who identifies as non-binary in 2019’ The 2022 list included Erika Hilton, who was the first trans black woman to be elected to National Congress of Brazil, while Efrat Tilma was the Israeli police’s first transgender volunteer. This decision was said to have divided opinion among some of the BBC’s own journalists. The BBC was recently at the centre of another trans controversy after it opened up a training course, created to increase the number of female production staff, to anyone identifying as a woman. The six-day course, called BBC: Female Self-Shooters, aimed to teach women how to become camera operators, a traditionally male-dominated role in the industry. The BBC has yet to respond to the criticism.

"Jeff Bezos is expected to be """"aggressive"""" in selling more shares of Amazon on Tuesday, sources told CNBC's David Faber. Bezos may sell as many as 8 million to 10 million shares, which would amount to more than $1 billion worth of stock, the sources told Faber. Shares of Amazon closed down about 1.5%. It comes after Bezos last week unloaded about $240 million worth of Amazon shares, according to financial filings. The transactions were marked as contributions to nonprofit organizations, the filing states. It's unclear who Bezos donated the shares to. A representative for Bezos didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Bezos — who is the third-richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $170 billion, according to Bloomberg — still owns about 988 million Amazon shares, which amounts to a nearly 10% stake in the company. Since stepping down as CEO of Amazon in 2021, Bezos has accelerated his charitable giving, and has said he plans to give away much of his fortune in his lifetime. Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez in August pledged $100 million to recovery efforts in Maui after deadly wildfires ravaged the Hawaiian island. Bezos has said he sells at least $1 billion of Amazon stock a year to fund his rocket startup, Blue Origin, and in 2020 he launched the $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change. Earlier this month, the Amazon founder and executive chairman announced that he plans to leave Seattle and move to Miami, allowing him to be closer to his parents, Sanchez and Blue Origin's operations.

"BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 01: A view of the MasterCard company logo on their stand during the Mobile World Congress on March 1, 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. (Photo by Joan Cros Garcia/Corbis via Getty Images) Mastercard is doubling down on its efforts to detect and prevent fraud that's routed through cryptocurrency exchanges. The company told CNBC exclusively that it's partnered with Feedzai, a regulatory technology platform that aims to combat money laundering and financial scams online using artificial intelligence. Through the partnership, Feedzai will integrate directly with Mastercard's CipherTrace Armada platform, which is used to help banks monitor transactions from over 6,000 crypto exchanges for fraud, money laundering and other suspicious activity. CipherTrace Armada will be embedded directly in Feedzai's technology, rather than accessed through an API, or application programming interface, with Feedzai """"inhaling"""" the data to enable real-time alerts about suspicious crypto transactions. """"This will increase fraud detection by protecting unwary consumers, but will also detect potential money laundering activity and mule accounts,"""" Feedzai CEO and co-founder Nuno Sebastio told CNBC. Mule accounts are accounts of users that fraudsters exploit to launder their ill-gotten funds. An estimated 40% of scam transactions exit directly from a bank account to a crypto exchange today, according to Feedzai data. The tie-up will also give Mastercard access to Feedzai's artificial intelligence smarts. Feedzai says its software can identify and block suspicious transactions in a matter of nanoseconds — but also recognize transactions that are legitimate. Feedzai's RiskOps platform analyzes transactions worth over $1.7 trillion annually. Co-headquartered in Coimbra, in Portugal, and San Mateo, California, in Silicon Valley, the firm holds close to 100 patents and secures an average of 10 patents per year to safeguard its technology. """"Numerous banks that believe they are preventing illegitimate cryptocurrency transactions are, in fact, only blocking transactions involving the widely recognised and regulated entities within the crypto space and omitting the rest,"""" Sebastio said.

"The BBC has raised eyebrows over its green credentials after a Panorama programme on fossil fuels saw its presenter fly to to Europe, the Middle East and the US, prompting a senior MP to accuse it of 'rank hypocrisy'. UK-based reporter Richard Bilton worked on the broadcaster's BBC One episode, Why Are We Still Searching for Fossil Fuels?, as he questioned why 'the world is saying one thing and doing another' on climate change. The programme, meant to highlight the climate crisis and that the world is still using 'more fossil fuels than ever before', has been somewhat overshadowed by the row after analysis showed he could have covered more than 20,000 air miles. Mr Bilton flew to Dubai, Germany, California and Alaska for the show, which aired on November 13. According to research by the Telegraph, this could have produced at least 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide, more than the average a person produces in a year, which is 4.7 tonnes.

Dame Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood, told the Sunday Times: 'If the BBC feels it necessary to lecture the public about fossil fuels, they should practise what they preach first. 'BBC Panorama ought to do an episode on itself, namely how its reporter is globe-trotting on flights at the licence-fee-payers' expense. 'To add to the rank hypocrisy, the BBC could easily have used its local teams of reporters in each country rather than sending one man on a jolly.' Mr Bilton did acknowledge during the programme that he took 'several' flights in order to make it, adding it is 'hard' to fight climate change while continuing to use fossil fuels to travel and heat homes. It is unknown if crew for the presenter also flew around the world, or if local BBC teams were used. The UN has warned that the world is not on track to keep to the agreed target to limit global warming to 1.5C, with thousands of species of plants and animals at risk of extinction as a result.

"Starting next year, it should be less frustrating for iPhone and Android users to text one another. Apple says photos and videos sent between those devices will be of higher quality. Group messaging will be more reliable, and users will also be able to turn on read receipts and send their locations in texting threads. The changes will come once Apple adds support for a technology called rich communication services, also known as RCS, next year, the company said. RCS is like the more modern cousin of short message service, or SMS. Green message bubbles signal that they are coming from an Android or other non-iPhone user. But they have come to be associated with an unpleasant texting experience for iPhone users, whose messages are blue to indicate that they have been sent via iMessage. The green bubble is here to stay, however: It will signal when RCS is in use. The technology “will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users,” Apple said in a statement.

"READ MOER: The Tesla killer? Toyota claims its EV breakthrough will allow cars to travel 745 miles on a single 10 minute charge Toyota introduced hybrids to the mainstream with the Prius in 2000 America's best-selling car, the Toyota Camry, will only be available as a hybrid from next year. The ninth-generation Camry was announced in Los Angeles on Tuesday and is symbolic of the Japanese automaker's efforts to push hybrids deeper into the US market. The 2025 car will combine a 2.5-liter gas engine with an electric drive system. Although the Camry has been available as a hybrid since 2007, the gas-only model will now be discontinued. Toyota was the first automaker to bring hybrid cars into the mainstream, starting with the Prius back in 2000. Many Americans are skeptical about battery electric vehicles (BEVs), largely due to fears around range. That is not an issue with hybrid models, which are also powered by gas engines. The ninth generation Toyota Camry (pictured) will only be available as a hybrid from 2024, Toyota announced this week The transition to hybrid-only was announced in Los Angeles on Tuesday ahead of the LA Auto Show on Friday. Pictured is the 2025 model year car, which will be in showrooms next spring David Christ, head of the Toyota in North America, told Reuters that compliance with tougher US fuel economy rules was a factor in its decision. The car will no longer be sold with four and six-cylinder combustion models, which have made up about 85 percent of sales of the current model year Camry. Christ also said the company was motivated by 'the performance we were able to get out of the hybrid.' The hybrid powertrain and a new electronic all-wheel drive system deliver 232 horsepower combined - almost 15 percent more than the outgoing Camry with a mechanical all-wheel drive system, Toyota said. The new Camry will compete in a segment largely abandoned by American automakers, with the exception of General Motors' Chevrolet Malibu. The Camry has been available as a hybrid since 2007, but from 2025 it will no longer be just an option The hybrid powertrain and a new electronic all-wheel drive system deliver 232 horsepower combined Toyota has not yet disclosed pricing or fuel-efficiency figures for the 2025 Camry, which is due in showrooms next year, but the cheapest hybrid Camry currently sells for about $2,400 more than the cheapest gas version. Most of the hybrid powertrains sell at a $1,500 to $2,000 premium to combustion models, according to Christ. 'We think the value the hybrid powertrain brings is worth that kind of premium,' he said. Toyota previously switched its Sienna minivan to be hybrid only. The Toyota Venza the Sequoia are also only available only as as hybrids.

The German industrial conglomerate projects sales growth of 4-8% over the next 12 months, down from the 11% increase recorded for the 2023 fiscal year that ended in September, due primarily to a muted outlook for its industrial automation division.

"It has noted the doubling and quadrupling of two different types of scams Americans are excited for the upcoming holiday season, but so too are scammers. As Amazon gears up for its Black Friday sales and subsequent holiday spending, it has warned customers to be extra alert to prominent scams. Increasing number of transactions offer fraudsters more opportunities to profit and ways in which they impersonate Amazon to extract valuable information. The first scam is referred to as an email attachment scheme. According to Amazon, they have doubled in the second half of 2023 and are expected to ramp up ahead of Amazon's annual pre-Black Friday promotion, which starts on Friday. They involve emails from a scammer pretending to be an Amazon sales representative. Included in those emails are attachments claiming their accounts will be suspended if they don't take action. Scammers are emailing Prime members suggesting that they will need to forfeit details to rectify some issue with their account, Amazon has said Amazon has suggested scammers will make the most of holiday shopping by calling, texting and emailing customers and asking for their personal information The email will then direct customers to log into their Amazon accounts using a false website which the scammers can use to capture log in information. 'The bad thing isn't opening the attachment,' Scott Knapp, Amazon's director of worldwide buyer risk prevention, told CBS MoneyWatch. 'It's clicking on the link in the attachment, which goes straight to their website, where they start collecting all kinds of information.' Another scam Amazon has warned of involves more rudimentary phishing, and has quadrupled in frquency this year. An Amazon Prime delivery worker is seen sorting packages in an Amazon van in Queens, New York Scammers are also calling, texting and emailing Prime members suggesting that they will need to forfeit details to rectify some issue with their account, such as an incorrect order or an account fee. [item name=module id=119913159 style=undefined /] 'Coming into the holiday with big deals, they send out notices that there's problem and say contact us to straighten things out. Give us your credit card information or bank account info to verify it,' said Knapp. He advised that customers should never follow those instructions. 'That's something we would never do. We'd never ask for that,' he said. 'People should be careful or wary when somebody is trying to make them pay for something only with a gift card. No legitimate transaction is going to require you to use gift cards. So be on the lookout for that.' Earlier this year, an online marketplace selling millions of sets of stolen personal information for less than a dollar each was blown open as part of a sting led by FBI and Dutch investigators.

"Sweden-based truck and bus manufacturer Scania and Sweden-based global steel company SSAB announced today a new agreement for fossil-free steel, including a target to decarbonize all steel deliveries from SSAB to Scania’s heavy-duty vehicles in 2030. SSAB is the main steel supplier for Scania’s vehicles. Steelmaking is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 globally, with total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the sector accounting for 7% – 9% of direct emissions from the global use of fossil fuels. SSAB announced plans in 2021 to bring its fossil-free steel manufacturing technology, HYBRIT, developed in partnership with partners Vattenfall and LKAB, to market by 2026. HYBRIT replaces the coking coal traditionally used for iron ore-based steelmaking with fossil-free electricity and hydrogen producing water as a byproduct instead of carbon dioxide. Deliveries under the new agreement are anticipated to begin in 2026. Martin Lindqvist, CEO at SSAB said: “We are truly looking forward to ramping up the deliveries of our fossil-free steel, thereby contributing to more sustainable value chains. Fossil-free steel will be a game-changer in heavy transport. It has the same high quality and technical properties as traditional steel. And, while being produced in a sustainable way, it can also be recycled just like steel has always been.” The new agreement follows Scania’s commitment last year to decarbonize its supply chain by 2030, with efforts focused its key production materials emissions sources, with batteries, steel, aluminum and cast iron accounting for approximately 80%. Both companies are members of the First Movers Coalition, which encourages companies in sectors where decarbonization is a challenge to increase low-carbon purchases. where Scania and SSAB are members, to reduce the carbon footprint in hard-to-abate sectors. The companies said that the new agreement will support their goals to use their purchasing power to create early markets for innovative clean technologies. Christian Levin, CEO at Scania said:
