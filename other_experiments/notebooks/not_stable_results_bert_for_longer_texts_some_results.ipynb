In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems. As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private. Many companies \\u201ctold me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns,\\u201d he said. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"political_and_religious_views\",\n          \"other\",\n          \"human_employee_rights\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 62,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"American Airlines\",\n          \"Spotify\",\n          \"Amazon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9,\n        \"min\": 60,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9,\n        \"min\": 60,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Timber would be floated down the Spey from forests upstream to multiple shipyards based at the mouth of the river. But the industry which made the location what it was would not be viable now given the changes to the river and the coast.\",\n          \"Toyota will introduce six electric vehicles in Europe by 2026, it announced this week.

In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems. As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private. Many companies \\u201ctold me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns,\\u201d he said. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"political_and_religious_views\",\n          \"other\",\n          \"human_employee_rights\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 62,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"American Airlines\",\n          \"Spotify\",\n          \"Amazon\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 100,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9,\n        \"min\": 60,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Certainity_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9,\n        \"min\": 60,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          100\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
