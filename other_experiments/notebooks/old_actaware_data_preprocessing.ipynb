Experts told DailyMail.com that trying to do a 'hard restart' is one way to fix the problem\\n\\nA bug plaguing the new iPhone 14 Pro Max is mysteriously freezing smartphones - sometimes to the point where the device is unusable.\\n\\nMany users have reported the issue, which appears to happen when users charge their phone, transfer data from previous phones or connecting to WiFi.\\n\\nIt comes despite Apple rolling out several iOS updates since the iPhone 14 Pro Max launched last September.\\n\\nOne user told DailyMail.com how her handset froze and died while charging overnight, meaning her alarm never went off. She had to wake her husband to call a cab in the morning so she wouldn't be late for work.\\n\\nMany frustrated smartphone owners are airing similar grievances on social media and Apple's official forum, noting that they have never had this issue with previous models.\\n\\nOne user wrote on Apple's website: \\u2018I charged my iPhone before I went to bed and woke up, and it's a black screen and won't turn on. I've tried clicking on the volume +/ - and power button sequence to no avail.\\n\\nApple will use chips made at a new $12 billion Arizona factory as firm pivots away from China CEO Tim Cook confirmed that Apple use chips from a factory in the U.S. in the coming years Advertisement !- - ad: - ->\\n\\n\\u2018Doing a quick online search, others are also experiencing this issue, and is sic some Apple bug. Not really sure what to do other than having to visit an Apple Store to get it wiped and OS reinstalled. How frustrating.\\u2019\\n\\nOthers report the handset freezing while in use.\\n\\nOne user of the iPhone 14 Pro Max wrote: 'This is happening to me ALL THE TIME. I couldn't even restart the phone for 2 hours as it sat on the screen to 'slide to restart'. It's infuriating and I have no idea what to do.'\\n\\nAnother described a recurrent problem that Apple Store employees could not fix, saying: 'With iOS 16.2 I am experiencing random freezes which force me to restart the iPhone completely.\\n\\n'I noticed it must have to do with the iPhone losing the internet connection (doesn't matter if on wifi or cellular) because I open, for example, Mail and it cannot load the mail. Keeps loading and loading, then the Mail app gets all white.'\\n\\nOn social media, users have described devices freezing when they open applications or trigger notifications.\\n\\nTwitter user Penny Henderson wrote: 'iPhone 14 pro max, hands down worst phone I've owned, glitchy, apps freeze daily, I think I'll ask for my money back! Apple it's not ready for sale. Should be ashamed of yourselves.'\\n\\nMac and iOS YouTuber Aaron Zollo said this month: 'More and more people keep telling me all the issues with iOS 16.2.

An expert told DailyMail.com that this issue may be caused by the iPhone being overloaded\\n\\nThe expert suggested closing open apps to relieve the overload\\n\\n'Next, press and hold down the side button (found on the right side of your device) until the Apple logo appears. This should resolve most freezing issues, but if you're still stuck, try plugging your phone into a PC or laptop and connecting to iTunes instead.'\\n\\nIf you are facing repeated freezes, Athwal suggests some measures that could help and are easily accessible from your iPhone's Settings menu.\\n\\n'Most of the time, iPhones freeze due to being overloaded by too many processes, so if the problem persists, I suggest closing any unused apps or changing what runs in the background,' he explained.\\n\\n'You can find this data in your Settings, and even set apps to only open when you need them.'\\n\\n'I also recommend keeping an eye on your storage as this can quickly slow down your iPhone and make it more likely to crash, so delete images and videos you don't want and transfer files onto iCloud as soon as possible.'\\n\\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Apple for comment on the issue but has not had a reply.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PublishedDate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ProcessingSteps\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NERs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QType\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"MatchedCompanies\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ImageUrl\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10685,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://actawarenewsdev.blob.core.windows.net/article-images/640e8eb51b843b2bcab095d9.png\",\n          \"https://actawarenewsdev.blob.core.windows.net/article-images/65009f3ba9db7bd5dcf5dab5.png\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home.\\n\\nNow it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer.\\n\\nThe move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year.\\n\\nIt signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle.\\n\\nReturns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store.\\n\\nFigures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US.\\n\\nMore generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales.\\n\\nThis is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back.\\n\\nReturned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits.\\n\\nLast month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses.\\n\\nBut the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices.\\n\\nAmazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's.\\n\\nIt encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees.\\n\\nAmazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations\\n\\nH&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022\\n\\nAmazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.'\\n\\nZara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year.\\n\\nIt was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"TitleTokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QTypeLogprob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17113032392279354,\n        \"min\": -1.7288656558,\n        \"max\": -0.001752815287,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2417,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.01874868716384,\n          -0.0205807598625,\n          -0.007729795147599999\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that.\\n\\n'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added.\\n\\nAs of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad.\\n\\n'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show.\\n\\nIn 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist.

Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively.\\n\\nIn the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home.\\n\\nNow it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer.\\n\\nThe move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year.\\n\\nIt signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle.\\n\\nReturns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store.\\n\\nFigures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US.\\n\\nMore generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales.\\n\\nThis is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back.\\n\\nReturned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits.\\n\\nLast month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses.\\n\\nBut the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices.\\n\\nAmazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's.\\n\\nIt encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees.\\n\\nAmazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations\\n\\nH&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022\\n\\nAmazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.'\\n\\nZara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year.\\n\\nIt was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set.\\n\\nHe later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.'\\n\\nPlans: The 'Frederick Douglass Conservative' also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism'; Pictured 2021\\n\\nDr. Burke: Washington rose to fame playing Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy.

'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that.\\n\\n'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added.\\n\\nAs of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad.\\n\\n'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show.\\n\\nIn 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist.

Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively.\\n\\nIn the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home.\\n\\nNow it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer.\\n\\nThe move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year.\\n\\nIt signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle.\\n\\nReturns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store.\\n\\nFigures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US.\\n\\nMore generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales.\\n\\nThis is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back.\\n\\nReturned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits.\\n\\nLast month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses.\\n\\nBut the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices.\\n\\nAmazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's.\\n\\nIt encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees.\\n\\nAmazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations\\n\\nH&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022\\n\\nAmazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.'\\n\\nZara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year.\\n\\nIt was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

              "\"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported. The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime' Alexander now faces having the role stripped from him after he reportedly signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel an 'apartheid regime' Aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City on October 11 The letter which was allegedly signed by Alexander, who is non-binary and uses he/him pronouns, said: 'We are watching a genocide take place in real time. 'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.' Olly Alexander performing live on stage with his band Years and Years at Wembley Arena in 2022 Sir Elton John and Olly Alexander perform during The BRIT Awards 2021 at The O2 Arena The UK has won Eurovision five times, with the last time being in 1997 when Katrina & The Waves performed Love Shine A Light . Prior to that, the UK stormed to victory in 1981 with Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up, and in 1976 with Brotherhood Of Man's Save Your Kisses For Me. In 1969, Lulu, who performed Boom Bang-a-Bang came first in a four-way joint tie with France, the Netherlands and Spain. The UK's first ever Eurovision victory came 11 years after the annual competition launched with Sandie Shaw's Puppet on a String in 1967. Israel has won the competition four times after its debut in the competition in 1973 as the first non-European country to participate in the event.

Knight - wrote. 'Those who have been Following/Witnessing my journey here on Twa***r since 2011 all know that I have fought the good fight, but it seems that the haters, provocateurs and the Useful Idiots have won.' The Texas-born star also shared his post-retirement plans: 'I'm no longer interested in the back and forth regarding a \\\"color construct\\\" that keeps us human beings divided nor am I interested in politics or anything vitriolic. I will be traveling this great country before it falls into Socialism and then Communism.'

Washington went on to add: 'I am truly grateful for your support over the years. It looks like CORSICANA #CorsicanaMovie may be the last time you see me as an Actor born here in America.' He wrapped up his statement writing: 'Just know that I will be posting a few pictures of my retirement shenanigans here and there, but until then. Be safe out there. Your loved ones love you and need you. SALUTE!' Isaiah stars as Bass Reeves in the 2022 film Corsicana, which he says will be his last. He also directed and wrote the feature. The film follows former slave turned U.S. marshal who tracks an outlaw gang of killers to Corsicana, Texas. The thriller also stars Lew Temple, Stacey Dash and Noel Gugliemi. Washington rose to fame playing the highly skilled cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. He was an original cast member of the show, but was fired in 2007 following three seasons, after being accused of using a homophobic slur in reference to co-star T. R. Knight - who later came out as gay - while arguing with co-star Patrick Dempsey on set. He later denied using the term as a slur, and claimed he instead told Patrick to stop treating him like an 'F-word', which he said meant 'somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back.'

He spoke on KBLA Talk 1580 radio show saying that his firing 'was an agenda to cover up for the toxic and bad behavior of many of my former castmates on that show ... and the top of that would be Patrick Dempsey.' Washington said that his tension with Dempsey, 57, was initially based on finances. 'I was the highest paid person on that show, next to Patrick Dempsey,' he said. 'Apparently, it got out, so there was a lot of resentment. I understand that but it was based on my roles and my resume. I can't help that. 'He was called Pilot Poison. No one wanted him on the show. They wanted Rob Lowe,' he added. As of the incident involving T. R. Knight, 49, Washington said Knight was not present when he used the offensive phrase, and that the story with Dempsey was twisted to make him look bad. 'It went from us having a brawl, which was never a brawl, to me saying something about T.R.,' Washington said, adding that he was 'coerced to apologize' to keep his spot on the hit show. In 2014, he reflected on his experiences on the show and said: 'I don't worry about whether or not the stories I tell will destroy my acting career, because you can't take away something that doesn't exist.

The e-commerce giant slaps the sum on returns made to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to the shopper's delivery address. But the sum is a relatively modest charge compared to other big brands which have increasingly begun implementing similar fees. T.J. Maxx, for example, charges $10.99 for the returns process and shipping costs while J.Crew, H&M and Zara charges $5.95, $3.95 and $7.50 respectively. In the past shoppers have been able to return any Amazon product without charge. But it began charging some return fees in 2022 - for example when customers wanted items picked up directly from their home. Now it is extending fees to those who use a UPS store to drop-off the item when an Amazon-owned shop is closer. The move is part of the retailer's wider mission to slimline its operations after it laid off 9,000 corporate and tech workers this year. It signals a dramatic shift in attitudes from the website which made its reputation for being extremely convenient and low hassle. Returns are an increasingly expensive headache for all retailers after they skyrocketed during the pandemic when shoppers were forced to do all their shopping online - without testing products in-store. Figures from the National Retail Federation show customers returned roughly $428 billion in merchandise in 2020 - accounting for 10.6 percent of retail sales in the US. More generally the NRF estimates that the average retailer incurs $106 million in merchandise returns for every $1 billion it makes in sales. This is because companies have to cover costly shipping fees for customers to send their products back. Returned items also often have to be marked down to resell them - squeezing profits. Last month Amazon already launched a new 'frequently returned' warning on some of its products to reduce return-related expenses. But the new fee is aimed at deterring customers from using UPS when they have other choices. Amazon owns Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh and has a partnership with Kohl's. It encourages customers to return their items by dropping them off at one of these locations - rather than incur shipping fees. Amazon has started charging a $1 fee on some of its returns made via UPS as part of its plan to slimdown operations H&M started charging $5.95 on its online returns in September 2022 Amazon spokesperson Lauren Samaha told The Information: 'We offer convenient, easy returns to Amazon customers, with one or more options for label-free, box-free returns at no cost.' Zara first announced it would start charging customers for online returns in June last year. It was shortly followed by H&M which made a similar announcement the following September.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

              "\"The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed a letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime'. The Years And Years frontman, 33, was unveiled as next year's candidate for the UK during the Strictly Come Dancing final, which aired on the BBC on Saturday. But he now faces having that role stripped from him after he signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel as an 'apartheid regime' which is trying to 'ethnically cleanse' Palestine. The statement, which was published on October 20, almost two weeks after Hamas' October 7 attack, also says that Israel has 'terrorised' Palestinian people and there is now a 'genocide' taking place 'in real time'. The Conservatives have accused the BBC of 'either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck' for selecting Alexander, while a Jewish charity has called for him to be replaced and for the broadcaster to cut ties with him. The BBC is not planning on taking any action as the singer signed the letter weeks before he was unveiled as the UK's Eurovision act, the Telegraph reported. The BBC is being urged to drop singer Olly Alexander as its entrant for Eurovision after it emerged he signed letter calling Israel an 'apartheid regime' Alexander now faces having the role stripped from him after he reportedly signed a letter from LGBT charity Voices4London which described Israel an 'apartheid regime' Aerial view of buildings destroyed by Israeli air strikes in the Jabalia camp for Palestinian refugees in Gaza City on October 11 The letter which was allegedly signed by Alexander, who is non-binary and uses he/him pronouns, said: 'We are watching a genocide take place in real time. 'Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. 'We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. 'Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel's apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land. 'Since the violent creation of the state 75 years ago, the Israeli military and Israeli settlers have continued to terrorise Palestinian people.' 'Queer and trans Palestinians have long highlighted that pinkwashing plays a significant role in Zionist propaganda. 'We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. 'For the many queer and anti-Zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of anti-Semitism'. Olly Alexander was announced as the UK's entry for Eurovision next year The Years And Years frontman, 33, made the announcement during Saturday's live final of Strictly Come Dancing as the audience cheered along After it emerged that Alexander had signed the letter, a Conservative Party source told The Telegraph: 'Letting an openly anti-Israel singer compete on the same stage as Israel is either a massive oversight or sheer brass neck from the BBC. 'After they refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation, you would think BBC bosses would try to steer clear of causing any more diplomatic blunders. 'Maybe it's time to stop letting the BBC decide who represents the UK at Eurovision.' Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Jewish charity Campaign Against Antisemitism told the newspaper: 'The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme. It is appalling in particular that it condemns 'unthinking philosemitism. 'At a time when nearly seven in ten British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. The BBC can and must right this wrong.' Alexander is set to represent the UK in Sweden in 2024 and has promised to 'fly the flag for the UK in the gayest way possible'. Following the announcement on Saturday, Alexander said in a statement: 'I've loved watching Eurovision ever since I was a little kid and I'm beyond excited to be taking part next year. 'As a young boy I always looked forward to this incredible event of unbridled joy, the wonderfully chaotic mix of musical styles, theatrical performances, heartfelt emotion and humour.' Olly Alexander performing live on stage with his band Years and Years at Wembley Arena in 2022 Sir Elton John and Olly Alexander perform during The BRIT Awards 2021 at The O2 Arena The UK has won Eurovision five times, with the last time being in 1997 when Katrina & The Waves performed Love Shine A Light . Prior to that, the UK stormed to victory in 1981 with Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up, and in 1976 with Brotherhood Of Man's Save Your Kisses For Me. In 1969, Lulu, who performed Boom Bang-a-Bang came first in a four-way joint tie with France, the Netherlands and Spain. The UK's first ever Eurovision victory came 11 years after the annual competition launched with Sandie Shaw's Puppet on a String in 1967. Israel has won the competition four times after its debut in the competition in 1973 as the first non-European country to participate in the event. MailOnline has contacted Alexander's representatives for comment. The BBC declined to comment.\\n\""

              "'Olly Alexander, the UK\\'s new Eurovision act, has been criticised for signing a statement accusing Israel of genocide and describing it as an \"apartheid state\". Alexander was revealed as the UK\\'s act last weekend after being chosen by the BBC to perform in Malmo next May. The It\\'s A Sin star signed an open letter from LGBTQ+ activist group Voices4London, which called for a ceasefire in Gaza and for Israel to allow aid into the area. The letter says: \"We are watching a genocide take place in real time. Death overflows from our phone screens and into our hearts. \"And, as a queer community, we cannot sit idly by while the Israeli Government continues to wipe out entire lineages of Palestinian families. We once said, \\'silence equals death\\'. Now is not the time to be silent.\" \"We cannot untangle these recent tragedies from a violent history of occupation. Current events simply are an escalation of the state of Israel\\'s apartheid regime, which acts to ethnically cleanse the land.\" The organisation added: \"We strongly reject the argument that holding a pro-Palestine or anti-zionist stance in any way promotes antisemitism. \"We stand against any and all harassment and discrimination against Jewish communities. \"For the many queer and anti-zionist Jewish individuals invested in liberation, this unthinking philosemitism, which hesitates to criticise an ongoing genocide out of fear of being seen to criticise Jewish people, is simply the other face of antisemitism.\" Advertisement Hamas killed around 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds more in cross-border attacks on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has since killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, 70% of whom were women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. A number of human rights groups have repeatedly labelled Israel an apartheid state, with Amnesty International saying: \"The discrimination, the dispossession, the repression of dissent, the killings and injuries - all are part of a system which is designed to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.\" Read more: Israel to compete at Eurovision despite boycott threats Ukrainian Eurovision winner on Russia wanted list says Kremlin is trying to \\'scare\\' her Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:45 What is genocide? In response to the Voices4London statement, a spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism told Sky News that Alexander should be removed as the UK\\'s Eurovision representative. \"The rhetoric in this letter, which is seemingly endorsed by Olly Alexander, is extreme,\" they said. \"It is appalling in particular that it condemns \\'unthinking philosemitism\\'. At a time when nearly seven in 10 British Jews feel afraid to express their identity in public, this must not be the person to represent our country at the Eurovision Song Contest. \"The BBC can and must right this wrong.\" Philosemitism is controversial term that can refer to a special interest in, respect for, or admiration for Jewish people, Jewish history, or Jewish stereotypes. According to the American Jewish Committee, it is \"often used in a benign and positive way and some may proudly declare themselves \\'philosemites\\' in affirmation of their allyship with the Jewish community\". \"However, some use the term to embrace or justify acceptance of stereotypical Jewish tropes like being adept with handling money, being well-connected to politicians, media, and other societal leaders, and more,\" the group says. Sky News has contacted the BBC and Olly Alexander for comment. The criticism comes amid calls for Israel to be dropped from the Eurovision Song Contest, with many citing Russia\\'s ban from the show. Organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, told Sky News this week that Israel would be performing at next year\\'s contest.\\n'"

Employees at the Hindley Street McDonald's, in Adelaide, reported 'almost daily' rat sightings to their union who sent a representative on December 8 to investigate. A new report published by SafeWork SA alleges that the rep was left waiting outside for 'an hour or two' after arriving at 12:15pm and eventually left. Workers at the diner have claimed that faulty wiring, falling ceiling tiles and the 'rat infestation' had created an unsafe work environment. A McDonalds spokesperson said that it is now in direct contact with the franchisee of the Hindley Street store regarding allegations made in the report. The Maccas on Hindley Street in Adelaide's CBD has been infested with rats for weeks, according to employees who have blown the whistle to the SDA (pictured rat in storage room) The workers allege that rats are seen 'almost daily' and that they have been caught 'nibbling' on the burger buns (pictured) One worker who wished to remain anonymous told The Advertiser that rat sightings and safety issues had become a normal part of the workplace.

The worker added that they once found a dead rat in the store and that photos had been taken of another rat nibbling cheese off of the floor in the storage area. Recently the kitchen also flooded due to a hole in the roof which workers were told to ignore and 'just keep working' through. Employees also complained of a lack of air-conditioning and inadequate supervision during weekend shifts. All of these concerns were reported to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) who sent a representative to confirm the allegations. The rep was initially denied entry by management at the store who asked them to wait 'for an hour or two' which the union deemed a 'refusal of entry'. SafeWork SA has confirmed that it was 'aware of the allegations and is conducting inquiries' of its own. A union representative was sent to investigate the allegations on December 8 but was refused entry by management at the rest (pictured) SDA secretary Josh Peak said that the restaurant had denied the union its 'legal right to investigate a rat infestation that was posing a risk to worker and consumer safety'. 'McDonald's should not be attempting to cover up health and safety concerns,' he said in a statement. 'Workers and consumers deserve to know that their workplaces and the products they sell are safe.' A spokeswoman for McDonald's stressed that the fast food chain took 'safety, cleanliness and hygiene very seriously'. '[We] and expect our restaurants to follow our strict cleaning, sanitisation and hygiene procedures at all times, including pest control,' they said. 'This clearly falls short of those standards, and we are addressing this directly with the franchisee and restaurant. 'McDonald's Australia [also] does not accept or condone 'anti-union' conduct within our business or franchisee-owned restaurants.'\\n\""
